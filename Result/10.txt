Null_: hey guys, i have a kind of confusing issue for me, I'm using index with ng-view routes in angular, served by express, I have angular pull web templates from url.  But, if I visit a site url like login, my express is set to static serve so how do I get angular to get the url template for somethig like /login
zomg: Null_: you need to set it so that express serves static assets to something like /static, and then has a /* rule to just serve your main page so it doesn't screw up the angular stuff
baako: morning guys
erry: Can i do something like
erry: img [src]=&quot;path/to/{{image}}&quot; /: ?

nishu-tryinghard: icebox, why dont i get suggestion to use &amp; binding when i google for directive communication? its so simple and straight forward
nishu-tryinghard: i can understand that the controller or directive which dont have the binding wont get the update but still this is what should popup if directive communication is required with its parent controller
icebox: nishu-tryinghard: because I would not call that &quot;directive communication&quot;
icebox: nishu-tryinghard: it is about bindings, specifically about function binding
nishu-tryinghard: icebox, yes but this can be use to share the data between controller and directive and yes this is very limited as it depends on binding
icebox: nishu-tryinghard: well... to share info between &quot;components&quot;, use services... you know
icebox: nishu-tryinghard: please, next question... :) I answered to &quot;why dont i get suggestion to use &amp; binding when i google for directive communication?&quot;
icebox: nishu-tryinghard: if you don't agree, ask it to google search team, because you don't see links you think they are relevant :)
nishu-tryinghard: ahaha yes now i get and i use services now after having a lot of discussing here about it with you guys

antiPoP: which router should I use in v2? angular/router or ui-router?
icebox: antiPoP: from scratch with router... if you know ui router, you can continue to use it
ExpertSystem: uncer: It is MVW. Why?
anli_: I have some bottleneck when I press a certain button on my webpage, can I get debug output from angularjs to see for how long the scope is applying?
antiPoP: icebox, I'm just learning v2, I guess that angular/router will work
antiPoP: seems they imporved it
ExpertSystem: anli_: You can use Batarang (it's a Chrome Extension).
anli_: Must check it
Elarcis: uncer: please refrain from asking the same question five times in less than two minutes
antiPoP: what I don't undesrtand is this template syntax: [(ngModel)] , where can I find a reference for it?
uncer: just read blog that angular is MVW. Is it true?
Pyrrhus666: [] is input, () is output, both is 2-way binding
uncer: ExpertSystem:just read blog that angular is MVW. Is it true?
icebox: uncer: link?
antiPoP: uncer, is mvvm
antiPoP: Pyrrhus666, ok, thanks
None
antiPoP: uncer, but can also be saw as mvc, make a search, actually it doe not matter too much
uncer: antiPop pls share link
None
antiPoP: Pyrrhus666, icebox  thanks
Torrone: Hello, I'm new to angular, I'm trying to edit someone else's code to fit my html. I have the module 'module' and I'm getting: &quot;Error: Argument 'module' is not a function, got undefined&quot;. How do I inspect this further?
Torrone: How can I find the cause of the issue?
uncer: Thanks antiPop
antiPoP: that's from 3 yrs ago, idk about v2
icebox: Torrone: veramente? :)
anli_: ExpertSystem: I have installed batarang, but I find no way of using it
icebox: Torrone: without any code detail is hard to help you
icebox: Torrone: generally speaking, debugging with devtools helps
ExpertSystem: anli_: Go to the page, open DevTools, Got ot the AngularJS tab, enable Batarang, reload the page.
Torrone: icebox, I've put a debug line inside my module but it doesn't seem to be running
antiPoP: so the @input decortator sys that the variable is passed as argument to the component, right?
antiPoP: so the @input decoratator says that the variable is passed as argument to the component, right?
icebox: Torrone: sure... if we need to imagine your code, you didn't give us any detaiI, I would say the problem is with those green creatures, called aliens
Elarcis: this week-end, I bought TIS-100. My mind is torn appart between satisfaction and regrets on my life choices
smiche: I need to have my node server running too while testing angular app with protractor?
None
None
smiche: no
smiche: at least I think not, more like .config(['$stateProvider','multi...',function($stateP..,multi..){}])
None
antiPoP: why this syntax? there is no binding here: [class.selected]=&quot;hero === selectedHero&quot;
antiPoP: and this one:  (click)=&quot;onSelect(hero)
Pyrrhus666: antiPoP: yes there is.
Pyrrhus666: class.selected is bound to the boolean eval of hero===selectedHero
antiPoP: ok
smiche: don't let the quotes confuse you :D
Pyrrhus666: and the click function is bound to the onSelect function.
antiPoP: and in the second? click is an event
Pyrrhus666: oops, other way around.
antiPoP: ok, thanks
smiche: Pyrrhus666 have you used protractor? I wonder if I need my nodejs server running too when testing, otherwise tests will fail for sure or be synthetic.
angularjs464: Hey guys, I have a problem with my AngularJS filter, I want to filter specific data, because the filter shows me irrelevant data, I am filtering data of a specific city and location, while I am filtering a city, so I only can see locations in Nijmegen, it also shows locations in Arnhem, how can get a filter sharper? Thank you in advance.
Pyrrhus666: smiche: no idea. I haven&acute;t done testing with any tool
Pyrrhus666: angularjs464: build a plunk showing your problem, this tells us too little.
smiche: I guess I'll leave testing for another time. Just having nothing to do and wondering what's worth spending time on.
None
Elarcis: angularjs464: show us your filtering code.
smiche: baako the problem isn't in your code, something is trying to inject translateFilter
smiche: or it's in another file where it happens
anli_: ExpertSystem: Ah, now I enabled it
anli_: thx
smiche: check IndexController
anli_: Hm, I see 12000 scopes created
anli_: Wonder if that is a good thing
antiPoP: I don't understand :  this.route.params.forEach((params: Params) =: {  Are there several set of parameters in a route? Why forEach is needed?
None
icebox: antiPoP: ops mistell
anli_: One scope is a total setup of variables, right?
None
icebox: antiPoP: yes, there are
Yagendra: Hello Team
Yagendra: m new in angular js 2
Yagendra: need some little helo
Yagendra: help*
Elarcis: Yagendra: helloooo
Elarcis: Yagendra: ah sorry, thought you wanted some hello
Yagendra: i am learning angular js 2
Yagendra: i have created a service
anli_: Using variables instead of functions is how the number of scopes is held down, right?
Yagendra: and from service m hitting n api
Elarcis: Yagendra: yep, that's the way to go!
Yagendra: my console working is working till service
Yagendra: but api not hitting
Yagendra: no error showing in console
Elarcis: Yagendra: you might want to put a debugger; instruction in your service call to see what's wrong
anli_: Is ng-change called on a select every time a option is repeated?
anli_: (with ng-repeat)
Yagendra: yes
Elarcis: Yagendra: other than that, we cannot help you much without seeing your code (not in the chat pls, use a text hosting service like pastebin)
anli_: So I need to use ng-options instead then
Yagendra: ohk thanks
Yagendra: let me try
anli_: Yagendra: oh, you did not reply to me?
None
Yagendra: sorry anli
anli_: np :)
Yagendra: is there any way to show my code 2 u
icebox: antiPoP: the best way to see it in action, it is debugging it
None
Yagendra: i m having api issu
antiPoP: icebox, probably, but a more detailed documentation would be nice
antiPoP: yes, I saw that
Yagendra: what i do??
Yagendra: i have tried a lot
icebox: antiPoP: you can contribute to fix it
antiPoP: icebox, sure, but first i need to learn it :)
icebox: antiPoP: I don't understand what you don't understand when we talk about an array of route parameters
anli_: ng-options was it :)
None
anli_: Not using an option with ng-repeat
anli_: The number of options was around 2000, so maybe thats why
antiPoP: icebox, if the parameters of route is a simple array, why it user forEach, then params['id'] ?
None
antiPoP: I'll try to debug it however
icebox: antiPoP: I see... but that it is a different question :)
\du: and a change of ng to use lastIndexOf() instead indexOf() for performance
antiPoP: icebox, maybe I explained wrong... just taking the v2 tutorial :)
icebox: antiPoP: and it is explained below that snippet
Yagendra: pls tell me how can i show my code
icebox: \du: thanks for the update... it seems great! :)
\du: np :)
antiPoP: icebox, &quot;Notice how we extract the id by calling the forEach method which will deliver our array of route parameters.&quot; but why the forEach is needed, why just don't do this.route.params['id']
icebox: antiPoP: please, debug it :)
antiPoP: 0.
antiPoP: ok
icebox: antiPoP: the question is legit and you get the answer in two seconds if you debug it :)
Elarcis: Yagendra: pastebin if you only got a piece of code, plunkr is you can/want to code a little example that reproduces your issue :)
Elarcis: Yagendra: for plunkr there's a template link in the channel's topic
master_op: Hello, what is the best book to learn Angular2
None
uru: The offical docs are very good too
master_op: uru: thank you for the link, i think i'll use this book because i prefer book to bootstrap and official docs for help and dev
icebox: antiPoP: got it?
uru: master_op: Quite welcome, for me the book has been a very good resource
None
Elarcis: does someone know what you call a UI contreol with two columns, where you usually can choose elements of one column to move to the other one?
master_op: uru: big thanks :)
None
uru: Elarcis: I know what you mean, it's on the tip of my tongue but for the life of me I can't remember
uru: Maxou: Going to need more info than that. Why can't you parse the json? Any errors? Plunker to share?
uru: Elarcis: Something like &quot;two column multiselect&quot; or somesuch
icebox: Elarcis: I second uru's name
Pyrrhus666: I&acute;d go for &uml;transfer multiselect&uml;. but that&acute;s because I googled :)
icebox: cheating :)
Xatenev: Heya people
None
Xatenev: is there any possibility I can add error messages to this while ONLY having access to the HTML?
Pyrrhus666: icebox: I was curious whether it actually had a name. big UI styleguides don&acute;t mention it though
Xatenev: Right now the fields are becoming red backgronuid only
None
Xatenev: It adds these classes to it on submit: &quot;ng-invalid ng-dirty ng-touched ng-valid-parse ng-invalid-required ng-valid-pattern&quot;
icebox: Maxou: where is &quot;.subscribe&quot; call?
icebox: Maxou: because the call is done only when &quot;.subscribe&quot; is called
Maxou: icebox: let me understand :D
icebox: Maxou: that is how observables work
None
hemangpatel: Hello, I try to implement aot in webpack
None
Maxou: icebox: i m going to read this thx for yours links
None
uru: Looks like icebox beat me to it :)
Xatenev: BUMP my question
Xatenev: lol
antiPoP: icebox,  the routers ramas is an observable object, so it could be more objects
antiPoP: roght?
antiPoP: right?
icebox: antiPoP: got it :)
None
antiPoP: ok, thnks
icebox: antiPoP: and forEach is an observable method :)
None
icebox: antiPoP: getting &quot;_value&quot; property
antiPoP: icebox,  actually router.params is a BehaviorSubject object
None
Maxou: icebox: thx again
antiPoP: and I can't find the forEach method on te dump, but I guess that this is fine for now... just learning the basics :)
icebox: antiPoP: :P
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: the error is not in app.component.ts, but app.component.ngfactory.ts. presumable something there is trying to get at the api-property of app.component.ts, which is private.
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: I guess that&acute;s your code, since I can&acute;t see it in the preboot starter.
hemangpatel: Pyrrhus666, app.component.ngfactory.ts is generated by ngc
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: ah, ok. then ngc is doing nasty stuff. I&acute;d stay away from the aot stuff until it&acute;s more stable, but ymmv.
hemangpatel: Pyrrhus666, aot is not stable ?
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: the whole angular-cli thing isn&acute;t stable, isn&acute;t ngc a part of that ?
veeru: hi. when will angular 2 will release?
Pyrrhus666: veeru: weeks ago.
veeru: beta version or original version
None
veeru: Thanks for the information
veeru: can i get any tutorials on angular2
None
veeru: any video tutorial on angular 2
anli_: Should I write &amp;&amp; as &amp;amp;&amp;amp; in an attribute?
None
Pyrrhus666: anli_: not if you&acute;re doing an angular expression.
anli_: But still, attributes are not supposed to use bare &amp; characters...
veeru: Thanks for the information
Pyrrhus666: anli_: yes, but with html5 any sensible standard went out the window so now nobody cares ;)
anli_: hehe
anli_: &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isnt even valid in AngularJS?
anli_: Hm, maybe is transparent
anli_: When you read the attribute, you will get the same value of course
None
hemangpatel: and angular-cli just implemented --aot option for it.
hemangpatel: I think aot is stable because they didn't mention anything in doc.
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: it&acute;s part of angular, but not part of the core. it has it&acute;s own package and version. it&acute;s in beta.
hemangpatel: Pyrrhus666, It's not mentioned in documentation.
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: I know. but check the versions and you&acute;ll see.
None
hemangpatel: Is it production ready ?
Pyrrhus666: hemangpatel: no
hemangpatel: 0.6.4 is stable or not. I don't understand
None
icebox: hemangpatel: &quot;One intentional omission from this list is @angular/compiler, which is currently considered a low level api and is subject to internal changes.&quot;
None
Pyrrhus666: didn&acute;t we discuss the sanity of angular versioning at length ? ;)
icebox: Pyrrhus666: endless discussion :)
Pyrrhus666: I guess we should have a &uml;is angular-* ready ?&uml; site for all angular modules.
icebox: Pyrrhus666: quite useless
Pyrrhus666: yeah, you&acute;re right. they&acute;ll never be ready :P
icebox: :P
veeru: angularjs2 uses which scripting language?
Pyrrhus666: veeru: js, ts or dart
veeru: javascript or typescript
icebox: veeru: both
icebox: veeru: you can use ES5, ES2015, ES2016 or Typescript
veeru: but i am unable to find the angularjs2 in javascript
veeru: in every example they have used type script
None
Elarcis: veeru: the doc has a switch at the top of the page which you can use to show the examples in JS
icebox: veeru: there is a switch in the docs... bottom-right
smiche: also typescript is js with types, it doesn't take more than a few minutes to get the grasp of it if you want to
Elarcis: veeru: sorry, bottom left corner
icebox: yep... bottom left :)
Elarcis: icebox: must be a monday
veeru: can u please provide me the typescript video tutorial
None
Pyrrhus666: dammit
Elarcis: icebox: wow, ng2 in JS is very less sexy
icebox: veeru: is out of order google there?
Elarcis: veeru: what typescript video tutorial?
icebox: Elarcis: well... I like it
ngWalrus: wow
Elarcis: veeru: you mean a video tutorial for typescript, or a video tutorial for angular 2 typescript?
ngWalrus: it's monday AND I can have beer
Elarcis: veeru: because in both case, I don't know any
None
veeru: video tutorial for typescript only
icebox: veeru: here #angularjs
icebox: veeru: there is a typescript channel
smiche: it's ##typescript
None
veeru: can u please provide me the link for video tutorial of typescript only not the angular2 typescript
None
ngWalrus: you could also use duckduckgo
None
Pyrrhus666: ngWalrus: nice ! noted :)
smiche: someone done any testing with protractor? do I need to run my nodejs during tests too?
smiche: nodejs server*
None
smiche: yeh but I wonder if I can have my server running while performing tests?
icebox: smiche: did you read the docs? did you try it?
None
veeru: can u please provide me the file upload progress bar in angularjs
ngWalrus: channel is busy today
None
smiche: get CORS plugin for your browser
smiche: and cordova whitelist plugin when deploying for android/ios
Maxou: smiche thx 8
veeru: can u please provide me the file upload progress bar in angularjs
icebox: smiche: you execute &quot;protractor&quot; to run the tests and it connects to selenium server... what is the question?
soee: if i have small searchbox component that loads and display 4 items in dropdown, than what would be the best way to pass th same search phrase and redirect to new state where longer search results list would be rendered ?
gigo1980: hi together how can i create an isolated test from an component that have an router in the costrucor ?
smiche: my question was if I can run the nodejs rest api server to provide data to the client and then test how it handles the data, but yeh I saw that I can do that now :d
None
icebox: smiche: yep :P
smiche: I was thinking it can only test the front-end code/emulate angular model or something without using server
icebox: smiche: if there is not any port overriding
smiche: okay time to configure everything and do some tests :D
icebox: smiche: well... you can, mocking data
LIERO: so in my app I get some JSON data from an async function in a node module and store it in a variable
LIERO: simply $scope.myThing = myVar; doesn&acute;t update the view
LIERO: i need to do a $scope.apply :
LIERO: ?*
\\\\\\\\\: yea
icebox: LIERO: no... you broke the reference :)
LIERO: icebox, how&acute;s that?
LIERO: because $scope.apply didn&acute;t work :.:
icebox: LIERO: angular adds automagically a watcher to objects (and arrays) not to primitives values... when you update data, you need to be aware not to override the reference you passed to the scope
None
None
veeru: is anyone available?
icebox: veeru: sure... but we cannot write the code for you
veeru: but suggest me how to do that
smiche: css opacity
LIERO: what &uml;reference&uml; have I passed to the scope to begin with, icebox?
None
LIERO: i&acute;m not quite sure what it is I&acute;m overriding
LIERO: I&acute;m not passing anything between controllers
icebox: off... for a break... see you  later
LIERO: or factories
None
icebox: LIERO: I am sure if you provide a plunker reproducing your use case, someone in the channel may give a look at it
coder_2014: what would be the best way of loading components dynamically defined in an string[] ?
None
coder_2014: not exactly
smiche: if the components are predefined, use a component with a template with ng-if and and ng-repeat
smiche: change their display value in the array and it should display them/hide them dynamically, also it should destroy the scope of hidden ones
None
Pyrrhus666: baako: it&acute;s deprecated, I guess nobody should use it.
baako: okay
Pyrrhus666: you did read the first paragraph of what you linked, right ? ;)
baako: yes i di Pyrrhus666
None
baako: a drop down with search option
None
None
Pyrrhus666: smiche: NO!
smiche: okey, okey :D
Pyrrhus666: smiche: you cannot suggest anybody to use semantic-ui :P
smiche: I haven't used it, dunno if it's bad, I can only tell it looks slick :D
Pyrrhus666: semantic-ui ditches all and any html element and only uses div for everything. it&acute;s evil ;)
Pyrrhus666: check the source of the select, you&acute;ll see ;)
coder_2014: I'm trying to load a component by it's string representation instead of using the Component itself - i.e.this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(Component) so instead of Component I need to use &quot;Component&quot;
coder_2014: anybody can give me a hint on how can I do it please?
smiche: Pyrrhus666: using divs makes it bad? because it's heavy and it wouldn't work as well on phones or?
smiche: protractor is so cool though :D
Pyrrhus666: smiche: because only using divs makes it very non-semantic.
smiche: oh, alright
Pyrrhus666: smiche: it all a bloody opinion of course ;)
Elarcis: smiche: it /looks/ slick, until you realize there's a mini size for some stuff and not for other that could potentially go next
Elarcis: smiche: it /looks/ slick, until you realize that active menu items can be colored, but non-active cannot
Elarcis: smiche: I'm using it, and it's a real pain. It's 'we're EXTREMELY permissive, as long as you do what we allow you to'
smiche: I suppose it's also not great with responsiveness?
Elarcis: smiche: it probably is, but we're using it for desktop only
bd-: wtf isn't angular-cli copying my static assets to dist dir
bd-: pretty sure this used to work in older -cli version
Foxandxss: it does with beta 17
bd-: not here it doesn't
bd-: although this has been upgraded from beta8
bd-: also 500 warnings every time do a build which didn't happen before
Elarcis: bd-: that's usually the main side-effect of jumping 9 beta versions
Elarcis: Hi Foxandxss!
Elarcis: How are you Foxandxss?
Elarcis: Did you have a nice week-end Foxandxss?
Foxandxss: I am fine&ccedil;
Foxandxss: triaging some issues
Elarcis: Foxandxss: sounds fun!
Foxandxss: work is work
None
baako: am doing something wrong but can you spot it please
Pyrrhus666: baako: what do you mean with &uml;my data is missing my module&uml; ?
baako: Pyrrhus666, it is not rendering
baako: but it does work if i do a normal select with a ng-options
baako: so i know i am getting data from the API
antiPoP: What does this:?  .then(response =: response.json().data as Hero[])
Pyrrhus666: baako: I have no idea. you seem to inject ui.select, so I presume something should show up.
baako: Pyrrhus666, i got it working now i think
Pyrrhus666: baako: there&acute;s a selectize example in the docs you could compare to.
antiPoP: returns an hero[] object from the response?
None
antiPoP: Pyrrhus666, i koonw about arrow functions, but what about the as keyword?
Elarcis: antiPoP: the json you get from the API has no type because of JSON's limitations. so Typescript allows to to type casting with the 'as' keyword, so it knows that response.json().data is an array of Hero[]
Elarcis: antiPoP: in JS code, this will translate as .then(response =: response.json().data), so the 'as' keyword is only useful to developers and TS compilation
antiPoP: Elarcis, and it's not missing a return statement? I only see a casting there..
Elarcis: antiPoP: as TS doc puts it, the 'as' keyword ist just a way of telling Typescript 'trust me, I know what this thing is'
Pyrrhus666: antiPoP: that&acute;s how arrow functions work
Elarcis: antiPoP: that's how arrow functions work
antiPoP: checking...
Elarcis: HAHAHAHA
Pyrrhus666: antiPoP: with an expression, a return is implied
Pyrrhus666: Elarcis: :P
antiPoP: I see, thanks :)
None
LIERO: maybe I need to use a promise to wait for the response?
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: dunno, but be aware that as far as I know console often shows references to vars, so it might update _after_ the actual log call.
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: you can do things like clone or toString to log the actual thing at the time of logging.
LIERO: hm
smiche: try defining $scope.myResult = {} in first line of the controller, I once had a similar problem and this helped
LIERO: i tried that too, smiche
LIERO: funny, if I give the scope variable a string value it, $scope.$apply() still doesn&acute;t update the view
smiche: what is speech.main?
LIERO: var speech = require('./node_modules/speech/recognize.js');
smiche: dunno, seems like fairly standard angular usage
None
LIERO: I know
Pyrrhus666: except for the fact that the speech thing is probably not angular.
LIERO: it&acute;s not
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: does it work serverside ?
LIERO: no server, all on clientside
LIERO: so the problem is I&acute;m getting something outside of angular, so no digest cycle is triggered
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: no, it isn&acute;t, if it&acute;s a node module.
LIERO: nwjs
LIERO: client side
LIERO: so I have to wait for the response to be ready and trigger the digest cycle myself
Pyrrhus666: as fair as angular is concerned that is serverside, no ?
LIERO: oh, well tight
LIERO: right*
smiche: if webpack it's bundled into client
yagendra: hello team
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: if this uses things like accessing the file system, it&acute;ll probably be hard, if not impossible, to do that with angular ?
yagendra: how to load any route directlr
yagendra: mean i want to redirect to manage page after insert data
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: then again, this is beyond my own experience :)
yagendra: in mean 2.0
LIERO: how so, I constantly use json data from node modules with angular
LIERO: i think I&acute;m messing up something simple
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: are you accessing those json file through the filesystem of via $http ?
LIERO: filesystem
LIERO: oh, and I have one service that does $http
Pyrrhus666: LIERO: ok. if that works I guess it should be possible. but then I&acute;m afraid it&acute;s beyond me...
None
icebox: back... :)
icebox: LIERO: resolved?
LIERO: i&acute;m afraid not)
icebox: LIERO: ok... what do you need? an example with $http updating a view?
icebox: LIERO: or is your use case different?
Pyrrhus666: icebox: more like an example of webkit speech recognition running with angular and nwjs ;)
LIERO: apparently it is
visualshock: Can someone explain to me how .subscribe works?
icebox: Pyrrhus666: nwjs/nodejs/electron doesn't change the game :)
LIERO: ^ that&acute;s what I think to
LIERO: too*
LIERO: i&acute;m probably messing something up in angular
LIERO: the data is there, it logs to console
icebox: LIERO: ok... I prepare a minimal workin plunker... we can start from there... ok?

Pingless: Does anyone know if &quot;disabled&quot; is a reserved word for directives in 1.x? I'm trying to add a binding to a component and it's not showing up, but other bindings work fine
None
Pingless: thanks uru, that is spectacularly unhelpful
uru: As far as I am aware there's no restriction on directive names though
Pingless: I'm talking about binding names
Pingless: and I was not talking about JS reserved words, but whether angular considers the binding name &quot;disabled&quot; in a special manner
uru: Ah right, sorry, I'll just go back to sleep then
Pingless: thanks for your condescending answer though
Pyrrhus666: Pingless: if it&acute;s an attribute directive called &acute;disabled&acute; I gues your browser might be f*cking it up ;)
visualshock: I do a http call and then subscribe to it, inside the subscribe I do another http call. Why does the http inside subscribe trigger first?
Pingless: Pyrrhus666: ah, that might be it. Thanks, I'll stick with my workaround of calling it &quot;is-disabled&quot;
uru: Pingless: It was not intended to be condescending, sorry if it came over like that
Pingless: uru: thanks
Pingless: visualshock: as far as I'm aware it shouldn't. Could you paste the code in pastebin or similar?
None
visualshock: newUnit() saves a org unit, and then reload the list to display the new item.
visualshock: but that doesn't happen
andy332: why angular.io doesn't work?
Maxou: why span:{{ article.field_image[&quot;0&quot;].url }}/span: giv me the url and img [src]=&quot;article.field_image[&quot;0&quot;].url&quot;: not ??
Pyrrhus666: andy332: works fine here ?
icebox: visualshock: you need to return an observable to use &quot;.subscribe&quot;... does &quot;return this.http.map&quot; returns an observable?
andy332: I can't open www.angular.io in my browser, is it something wrong with site?
icebox: andy332: no
None
andy332: what i need to do to open it?
icebox: andy332: a browser
Pyrrhus666: andy332: fix your network. we can&acute;t do that for you
Elarcis: andy332: some proxies block websites like they're down
icebox: Maxou: &quot;...&quot;...&quot;...&quot;? is it correct? single quote / double quote?
Maxou:  try something like that  :img [src]=&quot;article.field_image[\&quot;0\&quot;].url&quot;:
Maxou: the url is well in code now but the html img tag is not use
visualshock: icebox, ah, I guess not. thanks!
icebox: visualshock: you are welcome
icebox: visualshock: I mean... this.http.get is ok... but this.http.get.map I am not sure
Maxou: icebox try too :  img [src]=&quot;article.field_image[0].url&quot;: url is here but img html tag dont work
icebox: Maxou: you should debug it or you may provide us a minimal working plunker reproducing your use case
Pyrrhus666: Maxou: why are you even using [src] ? are you sure that&acute;s what you want to do ?
icebox: Maxou: indeed I didn't understand if you are using angular 1 or angular 2
None
Maxou: icebox : 2
icebox: Maxou: I don't want to read your tutorial... :) please you should narrow your issue,
icebox: Maxou: two lines in a plunker should describe your use case
icebox: Maxou: if you want a concrete help... otherwise with only guesses we can stay here for hours
Pyrrhus666: Maxou: are you sure you&acute;re not looking for smt like img src=&uml;{{article.field_image[0].url}}&uml;:
icebox: Pyrrhus666: in angular 2?
Maxou: he don't use thise form in the tutorial
Pyrrhus666: icebox: why not ? interpolation is still a thing in ng2 ?
Maxou: button ion-item *ngFor=&quot;let user of users&quot;:ion-avatar item-left:img [src]=&quot;user.avatar_url&quot;:/ion-avatar:
icebox: Pyrrhus666: right :P
Maxou: oh : i think i found the issu
Maxou: he said jsut after : Remember our user model had an avatar_url property, hence the user.avatar_url.
Maxou: my model is not good I suppose
Elarcis: damn, found a bug in Typescript
Perseus0: bros, any decent ng1 cli?
icebox: Perseus0: what for?
Perseus0: for generating projects
Perseus0: as in the ng2 cli
icebox: Perseus0: feel free to implement one :P
Perseus0: i've seen 2 already
Perseus0: one of them uses the same cli cmds as the ng2 official cli
Pyrrhus666: Perseus0: I&acute;ve tinkered with an angular-generator for yeoman once. didn&acute;t like it one bit though.
Pyrrhus666: is yeoman even still a thing ?
\\\\\\\\\: haha no
Pyrrhus666: it&acute;s impossible to tell with the js ecosystem being as volatile as it is :)
Elarcis: who uses backslashes now that we have string templates, anyway \\\\\\\\\
Elarcis: who here does Typescript?
None
bd-: what am i looking at
bd-: and who uses tinyurl these days
bd-: probably the same kind of person that uses \\\\\\\
Pyrrhus666: Elarcis: is that even a legal construct, that (number | string)[] ?
Elarcis: Pyrrhus666: yes, it's like saying Arraynumber | string: I believe
Elarcis: Pyrrhus666: basically all my items can either be string or number
Elarcis: bd-: I'm using tinyurl since the URL is too long for some IRC clients
baako: Pyrrhus666, hi with the ui-select can you pass a value to a controller?
Pyrrhus666: baako: the ui-select binds to a model value that&acute;s in the current controller&acute;s scope. what do you want to do ?
None
baako: Pyrrhus666, i want to pass the id not the address id to a function in the controller
baako: angular has the $watch function but i dont know how to use it with this has this project is not using scope
Pyrrhus666: baako: sorry, I have no idea why you&acute;re getting the wrong id. but it has nothing to do with a $watch I think
baako: am not using $watch
visualshock: What is the correct way to add dataset values to an element with angular?
geoid: For the life of me I can't find a download link for Google Materials angularjs libraries?
Pyrrhus666: geoid: probably because you should &uml;npm install&uml; it ?
geoid: probably that yes
None
visualshock: I set data-id=&quot;{{unit.id}}&quot; on a element, but when I try to access it(event.target.dataset.id), it is undefined. Is there a special way to add dataset variables in angular2?
baako: icebox, hi man#
None
icebox: baako: hey
icebox: baako: weirdly... I was thinking about you :P
baako: ahaha
baako: same here icebox
icebox: baako: what is the question?
Pyrrhus666: are we witnessing the start of something beatiful here ?
icebox: Pyrrhus666: sure :P
baako: icebox,  i want to pass the id to a function in the controller
None
Pyrrhus666: icebox: your turn on this code :P
baako: because of the way this project is set, i cannot watch(don't know how to) the vm.campusselect model
icebox: baako: we may resolve it better, if you create a working plunker with your use case
icebox: baako: in that code there are a few errors in code style and a few other errors breaking the reference
icebox: baako: generally speaking, passing a value to a function in a controller should not be a problem for you
baako: am using the ui-select and it doesnt have an attribute which does this
icebox: baako: really you should provide a minimal working plunker with your concerns, so we may give you a concrete help
baako: icebox, doing it
icebox: baako: passing a value to a function in a controller is a different thing than using a specific model with ui select
icebox: Elarcis: how is your project?
Elarcis: icebox: my project? ho. I've been having fun again today
icebox: Elarcis: I see... porting terminated?
Elarcis: icebox: HAHAHA
Elarcis: icebox: no
Elarcis: icebox: but I've been porting something almsot straight forward
Elarcis: icebox: so it's a bit more fun
kenyj: Hello guys
kenyj: I'm working with Angular 2 but my question is a little more about css than Angularjs, but it has both
icebox: kenyj: no questions, no answers
kenyj: Haha
kenyj: I'm typing it
kenyj: icebox: Why when I select an option, the selected option doesn't changes the background color.
None
kenyj: that's actually sass tho
kenyj: not css
kenyj: but it's almost the same thing
kenyj: I can see the options in blue color, but when I pick one, it's on white.
None
baako: also what errors do i have please
icebox: kenyj: any working plunker to debug?
kenyj: Hmm no..
icebox: baako: for instance, iife is not necessary... then vm.campuses = response.data; // breaks the reference
icebox: baako: and so on
baako: icebox, ?
baako: iife?
icebox: baako: iife (function() { }()) immediate invoke function expression
baako: icebox, so what do you suggest?
icebox: baako: var vm = angular.extend(this... is not necessary
baako: and also do you have an answer to the plnkr please
icebox: baako: I didn't understand what is your problem with that code?
Pyrrhus666: baako: your plunk works fine, it doesn&acute;t show the problem/
subone: Does anyone know if the angular dependency system can be reused for my own purposes, or know of another lightweight dependency system?
icebox: baako: (about code style you may read a code style guide, by John Papa or Todd Motto)
icebox: subone: you mean, DI in angular 1?
None
subone: icebox: yeah, sorry if that was ambiguous, I'm not familiar with ng2
None
subone: I want to componentize some d3,  but I need a way for one component part to require another component  part that, for example, sets some variable needed by both
icebox: subone: I would use the standard module approach
icebox: subone: that use case is not related with your question :)
subone: It's not? I need a way to do DI, I figured maybe I could reuse angulars
baako: Pyrrhus666, i want to get that &quot;output&quot; in a controller so when you select from the lets i want to get it from the controller(script.js) so i can pass it to a different function to do something else
icebox: subone: no... your use case is related how to integrate an external lib in angularjs :)
subone: Is it?
subone: I can already use them together
icebox: subone: , sure, it is
subone: I have d3 as a service
subone: I'm using it together just fine
Pyrrhus666: baako: you already have it in the controller (indexcontroller in this case) ? I&acute;m not getting you ?
icebox: subone: well... better a directive
subone: d3 is a service which is only currently used by my custom  directives
icebox: subone: usually when there is a dom manipulation, it is better a directive
icebox: subone: ok
icebox: subone: and what is the question?
subone: yes, I am using directives, but I want a way to for example have horizontal-graph directive and maybe a width directive, that sets variables for the horizontal drawing part
icebox: subone: and this last question is related to di?
baako: Pyrrhus666, console.log it in the controller let says i tried console.log(vm.campusselect) in the controller and got nothing
subone: dependancies are a bit more complicated than just rearranging directive priorities
icebox: subone: I suppose it is a different question
kenyj: Already fixed it
subone: icebox: just need a way to say X requires Y before it can run
kenyj: I had to add select, select option
kenyj: to the sass selector
icebox: subone: usually you don't need that... what is your use case?
None
subone: IDK what else you want to know
subone: not looking for design assistance really, just the DI info
subone: I'll look into the link
icebox: subone: sorry, I don't follow you
subone: which part?
icebox: subone: di -: d3 -: horizontal-graph directive -:  X requires Y before it can run
subone: some things need to run before others, like to set variable needed by other &quot;renderers&quot;
None
Pyrrhus666: baako: I guess you&acute;re looking for the on-select event. it&acute;s in the docs.
icebox: subone: ok... you need to do something before rendering the view?
icebox: subone: I understand you need &quot;resolve&quot; feature in routing
None
subone: router?
icebox: subone: is your app a SPA?
baako: Pyrrhus666, thanks man
icebox: subone: don't you display the views via routing?
subone: on each d3 update I need to organize the components so that they are in the correct order when run. For example, width needs to be calculated before the graph can draw, but there may be a &quot;middleware&quot; that changes this width before the graph is drawn, I need a way to check component dependencies on each update
icebox: subone: I explain how I have been using d3... and I hope it makes sense for you
subone: I just need a lightweight DI framework...
subone: anyone?
icebox: subone: I have d3 code in a link method of a directive... I update data used by d3 passing new data via attributes of the directive
subone: Thanks for your help icebox
Pyrrhus666: I&acute;m off. later peepz !
icebox: subone: you are welcome
icebox: Pyrrhus666: bye
kenyj: Hey guys I have a question regarding to Angular 2?
kenyj: How do I select a value by default in my select-box?
icebox: kenyj: giving a default value to the model?
kenyj: Exactly
kenyj: This is my ob ject
subone: bottlejs may suffice
kenyj: houses: ObservableArrayHouse::;
kenyj: So I receive the API object there.
kenyj: this.houses= this.houseService.getHouses();
Preuk: \\\\\\\\\: everytime you do that, a chatbot dies in pain
icebox: off... bye
kenyj: icebox: what?
icebox: kenyj: what what?
Preuk: \\\\\\\\\ O /////////
kenyj: icebox: I was expecting an answer :(
icebox: kenyj: I gave you :)
kenyj: kenyj: Funny :P
icebox: kenyj: there is also an example in ToH
kenyj: kenyj: Oh really?
kenyj: With obserables?
kenyj: I mean I already know how to do that
icebox: off... really
kenyj: but I'm not sure how to do it with observablesHouse:
Snugglebash: is it ever good to reference a variable in a service using ng-repeat?
tangorri: is angular.io down ?
uru: tangorri: Not for me
uru: Lots of people seem to be asking that today
coder_2014: I'm using componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory() and createComponent() in order to dynamically create components based on a pre-loaded list. How do I bind @Input() params afterwards?
kenyj: How can I select a default value in the model when the object that I'm receiving is an ObservableArrayObject::?
kenyj: (Angular2)
arpan: please be provide indetailed documentation for routing
pramod: Hi all
arpan: hi
arpan: do u know about routing how it will works
pramod: could you please help me understand , why at times scope variables wont update
pramod: yeah i know about routing
Elarcis: HOLY SH-
Snugglebash: Elarcis: hi
pramod: Anyone?
Elarcis: got a stupid bug, guessed the cause, even though it was absurd
Elarcis: I have an object with properties such as packing_density, cost, absorption, min_dosage, etc.
Elarcis: and at one time, I realize that my object lost some properties, like cost and absorption
pramod: are the variables not updated?
pramod: Elacris
Elarcis: 'holy sh-', did I tell myself, 'these are only properties with only one word in their name, could it be that we're changing the case and removing the value accidentally?'
Elarcis: bingo
pramod: what do u mean lost some properties
pramod: ?
pramod: you dont see them in your object, or the values of your variables not updated according to changes in the view
pramod: ?
Elarcis: pramod: well the object had these properties, but it turns out somewhere in the code, we turn dash-case into camelCase by copying the values into a new property name, and removing the old one. since cost and absorption are already camelCase, when removing the old name we also remove the new one :D
Elarcis: pramod: this is a issue I corrected myself, no need to try to help me
pramod: okay :)
pramod: cleat
Elarcis: pramod: this has to do with databinding and JS primitives
pramod: u mean the dirty checking phase?
Elarcis: pramod: somewhere, you lose the reference to the data you're updating, so the template still points to the old value
Elarcis: pramod: it often happens because you do $scope.myVar = aNewValue, but are updating the value that was assigned before, so your template points towards aNewValue, but that's not the one you're updating
pramod: so what's the solution that will update my values
Elarcis: pramod: without seeing your controller and service code, I can't tell you exactly, but one solution is
Elarcis: !sharing-services
Elarcis: !service-sharing
Elarcis: !sharing-service
Elarcis: FRNHJDSHFcksdYHFs
Elarcis: pramod: lemme a few seconds
pramod: sure
None
Elarcis: pramod: you'll see in this example, that sharedService only updates i.value, and returns i to the controller
Elarcis: pramod: which means every controller point to the same i object, and sharedService only updates its content without ever erasing i
Elarcis: pramod: this is one way to not lose your references
pramod: okay Thanks Elacris
pramod: Hi Elacris, whenever i go through the documentation, i see something called priority level
pramod: could you please brief me on this
Elarcis: pramod: do you have a link to a page that speaks of it?
pramod: yeah
None
Elarcis: pramod: ah, I see
pramod: if you see in the &quot;Directive Info&quot;
Ziberius: hello
Elarcis: pramod: it defines the order in which directives are loaded. higher is sooner
Ziberius: can i access current scope inside my custom services?
pramod: you can access through $rootScope
Elarcis: pramod: it's not a set scale, it's just that angular lists the directives for a set scope, sorts them by descending priority and instantiate them in that order
pramod: Elacris: so is it a instantiation order?
Elarcis: pramod: you usually don't care about it, I believe it's mainly stated in the doc to explain 'this directive will probably run first'
Ziberius: pramod: can't i send $scope as parameter?
Ziberius: i have a method that is repeated across scopes
Elarcis: pramod: yeah, except it's a tiiiny weeny bit more complex, my advice to you is to not worry about it for now
Elarcis: Ziberius: you usually don't want to access $scope in services
pramod: Ziberius: you can pass your $scope as parameter, but you cannot update your controller or view values by updating that $scope you passed as parameter to your service
Elarcis: Ziberius: this is the opposite of angular's design
Elarcis: pramod: of course they can, that's called references
Ziberius: Elarcis: ok then what is the recommended method for reusing methods across scopes?
Ziberius: thanx pramod, I don't really need to
Elarcis: Ziberius: define your method and all its dependencies in services, then call it from your controllers :)
Elarcis: Ziberius: services are the perfect place to put shared code
pramod: references would work when they are returned back , isnt it?
Elarcis: pramod: no...
Ziberius: Elarcis: yeah ok I think I get it
Ziberius: thanx
pramod: Elacris what i mean to say is, if you are passing a $scope to your service, and update some x in it, will it update the same x in view/controller?
None
Elarcis: pramod: yes, because it's the same x. that's references
Ziberius: cool
pramod: be right back!
Elarcis: Ziberius: although I strongly recommend against it, as it makes messy code and can be avoided by much simpler code
Elarcis: I won't, my day's done
Elarcis: bye!
pramod: Hi ziberius
Ziberius: hi
cojack: guys, could some one explain my why ngSubmit do page reload?
Foxandxss: you are probably doing a &quot;classic&quot; form submit
Ziberius: cojack: check for action=&quot;&quot;
None

cojack: Ziberius: check the html code
None
cojack: and component ts file
Ziberius: cojack: ok no action=&quot;&quot;, don't know then sorry
cojack: Ziberius: thanks, Foxandxss any advice?
Foxandxss: thought it was an action too
Foxandxss: perhaps needs a preventDefault?
None
cojack: s/as/like a*

Ownix: Whats the difference between passing data into a function or just getting the data on scope in the function? IE: ng-click=&quot;vm.save()&quot; vs ng-click=&quot;vm.save(vm.username, vm.birthdate)&quot;
Ownix: Is it just a preference thing?
GreenJello: Ownix, sometimes you need to pass something, like in a ng-repeat, so you can do it always for consistency
Ownix: Ah thats true, ng-repeat would benefit a lot from that.
scssquatch: Hey, have a question about inheriting functionality. Basically I have a service that I want to include into a controller, but I don't want to constantly do ctrl.service.method
scssquatch: I want to &quot;include&quot; the methods on the controller itself, so it's just ctrl.method, is there a clean/easy way to do that?
scssquatch: without explicily binding each variable/fucntion?
scssquatch: Basically like how include works in ruby/rails
scssquatch: Seems like angular.extend(ctrl, service) does this trick?
scssquatch: Nope, that's not properly binding them. Is this a strange thing to do?
