subone: Does anyone know if it's possible to create another instance of a ui.router? I want to match API URIs against ui states or other action. It looks like I can use $urlMatcherFactory, but I'd like to have a matcher collection, with routing
subone: I suppose I would be satisfied if I could simply invoke the appropriate matcher or 'when' handler with a specific URL, without having to actual change to that URL (haven't tried setting the location yet)

AlecTaylor: hi
Mavericks: AlecTaylor: hi
AlecTaylor: I'm confused, just started following that AngularJS 2 tutorial but it's scaffold is completely different from `ng` (the official CLI), and it doesn't use `ng` at all.
AlecTaylor: What is the official style &amp; scaffold?

rand0m: morning all
antiPoP: what should I use for websockets in angular2? socket.io?
zomg: socket.io is easy to use so go for it
rand0m: ye I agree with zomg
priyatham: hey hii
priyatham: can i start learning angular js after learning some basics of java script
Nasp: Yes?
Nasp: Why not
rand0m: he left a hour back Nasp
Nasp: Aha
Nasp: I have joins and parts hidden
Nasp: I should really make it remove people who just join and leaves
rand0m: anyways.. is imgur.com down?
rand0m: I keep seeing blank page
rand0m: nvm its back up
None
rand0m: antiPoP what are you trying to do
antiPoP: rand0m, using socket.io with the ngechev seed
rand0m: not sure what that is
rand0m: ah, ng2
None
antiPoP: yes, ng2
rand0m: maybe this will help
None
rand0m: ?
None
None
antiPoP: rand0m,  after importing socket io as import * as io from &quot;socket.io-client&quot;;
antiPoP: I can upload the code to gh if you want to take a look
rand0m: I have no clue about ng2 so I can't actually help you with this. I'm sorry.
rand0m: what is the add extenal link you posted?
rand0m: it just says how to include file
antiPoP: rand0m,  is the seed wiki
antiPoP: np, thansk
rand0m: I see that the project uses gulp
rand0m: why not use gulp socket.io client
rand0m: when you build your dev server, fire up this socketio client from a task and listen to specific port
rand0m: and when your dev http server runs, use angular to connect to said socket.io port and get data?
antiPoP: random angular 2 is different
antiPoP: I finnaly solved it :)
antiPoP: rand0m, thx anyway
learnme_: In ng-1.5.8 is should ngResource call $query() after calling $save(), I currently have a race condition being caused by this :P
learnme_: When I call myNgResource.$save(), I get two requests, because I pass in my object (which was an myNgResource.$get()) and this causes a race condition... What should I do to prevent this?
rand0m: I have no idea :|
rand0m: wait
rand0m: could you use promises learnme_
None
rand0m: like this ^?
learnme_: that's basically what I'm doing
None
learnme_: But, when I send my post request... it's calling something similar to... myNgResource.$save(myNgResource.$get())
learnme_: Which is causing a really wierd race condition.
rand0m: why :S ?
learnme_: I don't think I'm supposed to call it like that
rand0m: why not get first and save the data later?
learnme_: That's what I'm trying to do...
learnme_: I do something like...
learnme_: var myVar = Resource.get();
rand0m: like myNgResource.get().then(function(){ myNgResource.save() });
learnme_: and then I do something like Resource.save(myVar);
rand0m: no
rand0m: when you do var myVar = Resource.get();
rand0m: and  Resource.save(myVar);
learnme_: I'm supposed to pass in myResource.save(copyOfObjectThatsNotTheResource);
rand0m: how can you be sure that myVar in Resource.save(myVar) has the content you want
rand0m: you should do something like
learnme_: Resource bindings?
learnme_: Like, all the &quot;resources&quot; in my app are bound to Api endpoints
learnme_: But, I'm just messing up the js, lol
learnme_: &quot;messing up&quot; meaning royally fucking up, lol
rand0m: can you create a plnk?
rand0m: ar plnkr.co
None
None
learnme_: Check the script.js
learnme_: Basically, in my template, I bind lots of stuff to the resource with ng-model
learnme_: And I was hoping I could just call this.resource.$save() to save the updated resource
learnme_: But, it turns out that when I do that, I actually get two requests, one a post, one's a get.
learnme_: And it causes a weird race condition depending on which one returns first
rand0m: is that component a directive
learnme_: Yeah, it's a 1.5.8 component
rand0m: aaahhh
rand0m: idk wtf is that
learnme_: But, it's essentially the same as a directive
rand0m: i only know 1.5
rand0m: let me check
learnme_: I use it in my template files like... resource:/resource:
rand0m: make sense
learnme_: But, I don't think it should really matter if it's a directive or not.
learnme_: I'm mostly confused by the ngresource
learnme_: I feel like what I'm doing makes sense, but just slightly wrong
learnme_: like, if I call $ctrl.saveResource anywhere
learnme_: I get the same damn two requests, because of the method chaining
tmuwa: I am trying to learn angular2. Any hints for good tutorials?
rand0m: hay
rand0m: learnme
rand0m: learnme_,
rand0m: you still here
learnme_: yep
learnme_: I figured it out
None
learnme_: I was being all sorts of dumb, lol
rand0m: this is how you should be doing it I think
learnme_: Yeah
learnme_: That's how I did it
learnme_: I had a freaking ng-href=&quot;&quot;
learnme_: that was reloading the damn page
learnme_: every single time I submitted my post request
learnme_: Thus, post followed by get...
learnme_: leading to a reload of all my data, lol
rand0m: hmm
rand0m: nice one :)
learnme_: #ihateworkingonsaturdays
rand0m: its worth it man :)
supperman2k: is there an angular2 channel?
rand0m: there is supperman2k but I don't know sorry :(

Felishia: how do I select the scope of an element?
Felishia: I'm trying angular.element($0).scope() but with some elements it doesn't work
rand0m: angular.element(document.getElementById('yourElementId')).scope()
rand0m: ?
rand0m: or angular.element('[ng-controller=ctrl]').scope()
rand0m: or if you have jquery
rand0m: $('#elementId').scope();
rand0m: $('#elementId').data().scope();
rand0m: these are the only ways I know :s
Felishia: how do I get the name of the parent controller?
Felishia: actually
Felishia: my $scope has an attribute named teacher
Felishia: I cannot see anything that is setting the value for that
Felishia: yet it's populated
Felishia: how do I get who is setting that
Felishia: that's the problem
rand0m: no idea how to check that
None
Felishia: pls T_T
Felishia: I don't understand how the url is /:teacherId and the next one is /profile
Felishia: when my real url to get there is /:teacherId/profile
Felishia: are the .x.y somehow stacking the controllers?
rand0m: eh
rand0m: what dont you understand about /:teacherId
rand0m: and /profile?
Felishia: like the path is teacher/:teacherId/profile
Felishia: to get to the controller profile controller
Felishia: so I suppose the are stacking somehow
rand0m: doesnt it say
rand0m:  $urlRouterProvider.when('/teachers/:teacherId ... $state.transitionTo('teachers.detail.profile', $match);
rand0m: and
rand0m: .state('teachers.detail.profile', { goes to  url: '/profile',  controller: 'TeacherProfile.Controller',
rand0m: ?
rand0m: when :teacherId is present it goes to state detail.profile with id
rand0m: which I believe can be used in TeacherProfile.Controller
rand0m: brb in 20
Felishia: so why does it use teacher controller, detail controller and porifle controller
rand0m: not sure Felishia
rand0m: maybe TeachersController fetches a list of all teachers ?
rand0m: and TeacherDetails gets details of particular teacher
rand0m: and Profile controller is a generic profile controller (similar to TeacherDetails, but with less data)?
None
fnx: It's working as intended, although if you look at the console, there is some infdig-errors going on
fnx: Is there any way to get rid of it? The source of the infdigs is the filter
