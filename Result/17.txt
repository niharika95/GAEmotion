al_nz1: morning people
al_nz1: I am looking at ways to create a group of repeating fields on my form. Someone said angular is best to use for this? my project up to now is jquery and js
al_nz1: my form is in bootstrap
supperman2k: is there an angular2 channel?
icfantv: scssquatch: i would shy away from using `vm` in general and also the default `$ctrl` for components.  anyone reading your code will appreciate a named controller
None
HoloPed: I made the app, and I can see it in my browser, however
HoloPed: I see a bunche of like {{{stuff}}} for a fraction of a second, and then it's replaced with content.
HoloPed: Is that normal ?
Guest13187: hello everyone,I'd like to ask something about form validation with angular
Guest13187: I want to know something about the directive of the $error,$validator etc,I didn't see any information about these in develop guide.someone can help me where to find the information?
Guest13187: if somebody knows, please contact me with email 970590239 at qq dot com,thanks
Acer: how do you change the url of the page?
Acer: data-ng-click='$window.location.href='/new/url/{{id}}'&quot; isn't working
Acer: data-ng-click=&quot;$window.location.href='/new/url/{{id}}'&quot; isn't working
Acer: i am doing this inside a custom directive
Acer: so do i need to pass in window to be able to do this?
Acer: anyone?

arne_: is there any chance somebody can help me with md-autoselect of angular-material?
arne_: im using server-side filtering, and it seems as when i select an item, the search text change =: that results in a reload of the results =: that results in an unsent of the model
arne_: so whenever i select something it gets deselected immediatly due to the fact that the resultset changes
arne_: md-autocomplete*

veeru: i want to implement scorm player using angularjs. can u please help me how to implement that
arlekin: hi guys
arlekin: quick question: where are we at with angular-cli ?
Pyrrhus666: arne_:  var collection=Restangular.all(&uml;collection&uml;); to define your collection and later collection.post(object);
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: in a steaming heap of trouble ? (afaik it&acute;s beta)
arne_: Pyrrhus666: perfect, thanks
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: i see... i mean im getting started with ng2 and using starters seems kinda dirty to me, i hate being info-dumped, but then again i heard that there are still some issues with ng2 cli
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: why would starters be dirty and generators not ? they serve the same purpose : get you started ;)
Pyrrhus666: if you want to do it the ng2-way though, you should probably use angular-cli. it&acute;s supposed to be _the_ thing to manage ng2 projects.
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: its just cli seems to allow for more control (at least i think that in the end it should allow for generating things according to some preferences - kinda like npm init)
arlekin: and the second thing is that i'd have more trust in cli being up to date with removing no-longer-necessary polyfills and sosuch
arlekin: so its more of an emotional issue than technical one i guess
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: yeah, I guess that&acute;s the goal. it should also allow you to easily add components &amp; stuff to you project.
arlekin: exactly
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: thing is that it&acute;s a big black box. if it goes wrong it&acute;s difficult to fix (even if the black box even allows you to touch your project manually)
Pyrrhus666: so if you choose to use it, you&acute;ll probably _have_ to use it to do _anything_. that makes me hesitant.
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: now, that i don't get, since it should just generate files, the exact same files you'd have to make by hand...
arlekin: i mean going back to npm init example - there is no reason one cannot modify package.json by hand
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: if you only use it to init your project, fine. if you use it to manage you project, you probably can&acute;t add stuff or modify stuff outside angular-cli.
Pyrrhus666: (because that would probably break the management by angular-cli)
Pyrrhus666: I could be wrong, I know, but I&acute;ve seen too many all-in-one tools go wrong on me.
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: hmm...
arlekin: i guess if you'd want to do automated things on hand-made file there are plenty of things that could go awry
arlekin: on the other hand i don't see why creating new file with component, or adding new component at the end of existing file would be problematic
arlekin: frankly, given that its all code, therefore by definition parsable and structured it should be possible to work with it automatically
arlekin: i mean as long as it would be valid angular
arlekin: or wider - js
arlekin: i mean it all exists in the world - git slowly starts to be quite smart, and having intellisense as the highest example...
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: could be. that would suggest that ng-cli parses your project structure to do stuff _without_ keeping it&acute;s own config, separate from the code.
arlekin: thats not to say it wouldn't be quite a task to make
Pyrrhus666: and quite the task to debug when it goes wrong ;)
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: why couldn't it have some config (and of course it should be separate)
arlekin: also, there are ways to make it safe - like when you do some complex task with it it could ask you to commit, or make some temp backup with some utility to revert in case something messes up
arlekin: and again im thinking kinda like git allows you to do
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: because if it keeps a separate config, that would make manually adding to you project difficult (since ng-cli might not see the stuff you added since it keeps that data to itself)
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: oh well, i thought config as in - utility config
arlekin: i thought it should watch project and keep some cache of it for performance
arlekin: the cli should be totally and absolutely separate from project
arlekin: at least thats my vision of it, i hope that smarter than me people are working on it :P
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: that would suggest ng-cli should be able to work its magic without retaining any current or previoius state. that would be cool, but I don&acute;t know if it&acute;s that intelligent ;)
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: maybe you should just try ? you&acute;re still testing, right ?
arlekin: still testing meaning &quot;not yet working on anything serious&quot; ?
Pyrrhus666: yes, that&acute;s what I meant
Pyrrhus666: maybe I should&acute;ve said &acute;playing around&acute; ;)
coder_2014: how can I get the reference of a dynamically created component?
arne_: not at all
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: well, this discussion certainly sharpened my appetite and stimulated my imagintaion :P
arne_: you're not supposed to, the only exception is using require with components, where you can reference the controller of the parent-component
arne_: i guess
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: haha :) if you do play with it, I&acute;m curious to see what your experiences are with ng-cli :)
rand0m: morning all :)
Pyrrhus666: morning rand0m
rand0m: hello Pyrrhus666
rand0m: did you have a good weekend
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: for shits and giggles I tried to install ng-cli. it failed on install with some low-level npm error...
Pyrrhus666: rand0m: it was about 40 years too short ;)
rand0m: haha
arlekin: Pyrrhus666: well... you ever considered motivational speaking ?
arlekin: one word brah: DON'T
Pyrrhus666: arlekin: I would consider demotivational speaking though ;)

Elarcis: does anyone know a good design to do a validity check based on multiple form fields ?
Elarcis: basically I have to make sure that the combination of three field values does not already exist in a list I have
Elarcis: I could do a ngChange() on each field then check it manually
Elarcis: but I wondered if you knew of something 'cleaner'
Pyrrhus666: Elarcis: use a nested form for those fields, and a custom validator on that subform ?
Pyrrhus666: (that&acute;s what I did anyway)
Elarcis: Pyrrhus666: the fields aren't visually grouped
Pyrrhus666: Elarcis: hmm, then that won&acute;t work :)
Elarcis: Pyrrhus666: indeed :D
rand0m: are they in same page?
Elarcis: is it possible to have a custom validator applied to a whole form?
Elarcis: rand0m: yes they are!
Pyrrhus666: a custom validator on the whole form then ? seems more appropriate than doing it on the separate fields.
rand0m: then why not query them at same time and check at once?
Elarcis: Pyrrhus666: yes, that's what I had in mind
Elarcis: rand0m: that's what I'll do if I don't find a way to do it without having to put ngChange everywhere
rand0m: how do you want the check to happen?
Elarcis: rand0m: simple enough: when the user triggers a ngChange event, in my controller I check the combination of the unicity-related fields and make sure there isn't one item in my list that already has it. if there is, I put an error message for it
rand0m: but you just said that you didnt want ngchange everywhere :s
rand0m: when would you want to trigger the function in your controller which checks the criteria
None
Elarcis: rand0m: on ngChange, that's the point :D
rand0m: hahah
rand0m: I only thought rootscopes listeners would have to be destroyed
rand0m: or is it the other way around?
ngm: any help with npm build error in windows

Elarcis: icebox: more seriously thanks, I'll look into it
None
rand0m: Elarcis, icebox the example is as good as writing ngchange no?
rand0m: on each field
icebox: rand0m: well... it is a bit more flexible having a directive
Elarcis: rand0m: the behavior here is dedicated to a specific kind of validation
rand0m: ideally yes, but Elarcis said he/she doesnt want to go around all form items and add ngchange
icebox: rand0m: because you implement the logic of the dependency between fields in the directive
Elarcis: rand0m: and generic-enough to be reused anywhere
rand0m: generic only for the specific logic :D
rand0m: anyhoo, i'll go back to my work

wolfe: does anyone know if, for ui-bootstrap popovers, there is a difference in the HTML that can be processed in an HTML popover vs a template popover?
ngWalrus: one is compiled, the other isn't
ngWalrus: meaning html popover isn't compiled, the template is
wolfe: would that have an effect on certain tags?
wolfe: e.g. br /:
ngWalrus: no
wolfe: didn't think so...
ngWalrus: but if you need stuff like directives and interpolation you need to compile it
wolfe: having some issues and i've tried both ways, but either way just prints the br
wolfe: understood
wolfe: however, all i'm doing is printing a few items with a br /: between each
ngWalrus: should work without issues
wolfe: my JSON returns basically &quot;item1,item2,item3&quot;
wolfe: I do a replace for /,/br /: and then pass it to the popover
ngWalrus: you need to compile it
smiche: it's sanitized
ngWalrus: if it's a {{items}}
smiche: if you want to use html in your data use ngBindHtml, or ng-for and have br/: after each
wolfe: hm, okay
wolfe: still on the upside of the learning curve :)
smiche: I guess ngBindHtml isn't a great idea since I never see any1 suggest it and I haven't used it either
wolfe: ok, gotcha
wolfe: my data returns the comma separated list, which i need to split into lines.. so i pass it to a function that does the replace for , -: br /:
wolfe: is there a better way to manipulate the data with angular and use it with ng-for to accomplish the same thing?
smiche: sec I'll make a plunkr

None
blizzard: @Icebox, found something there but i don't know if my approach is wrong
smiche: uday: chrome dev tools is a good place to start
blizzard: how would you write a test case for a controller calling a factory($http)? Would you write test case for each or just test the controller?
icebox: blizzard: well... that is quite standard... if you don't see your approach in the official docs and in some resource out there, you know the answer :)
icebox: blizzard: one test for the controller with the mocked service, and one test for the service
wolfe: smiche: not seeing anything regarding ngFor in there..
smiche: ng-repeat, my bad
wolfe: but yea, i get the ng-repeat
wolfe: using it for other stuff, as well... but this case returns a list of values, not an array
smiche: split it beforehand?
smiche: check app.js
wolfe: yea..
wolfe: ok sec

Germanaz0: Hello everybody, I am using angular2, and am creating a directive, I am also using material2, my question is how to get the text from md-input using the directive, I was thinking to use the @Input decorator, but there is no value attribute
None
Germanaz0: icebox yes I was just checking that
Germanaz0: but what if is a directive, the input can have any name
icebox: Germanaz0: if the template of the directive contains something like md-input #nameInput placeholder=&quot;name&quot;:/md-input:... that is the way to access to the md-input
icebox: Germanaz0: really I didn't test it, so you should give a try :)
Germanaz0: ok
Germanaz0: but my question was, how to get #anyName if the related model can be dynamic
Germanaz0: the @ViewChild('ANYTHING:')
icebox: Germanaz0: no idea
Germanaz0: anyway thanks for reply
icebox: Germanaz0: I would approach step by step... firstly I would check if it works with the &quot;static&quot; case... then I would fina a way for the dynamic one
icebox: *find
Germanaz0: yes, static case did not work inside a directive
icebox: Germanaz0: that is weirdly... unless we are talking about two different things
icebox: Germanaz0: and here I stop because I didn't see any plunker reproducing that use case :)
None
Germanaz0: If I do a console.log(this.searchInput) is undefined :S
icebox: Germanaz0: sure... plunker, please?
Germanaz0: hmm I will try, am n00b at plunker
None
HoloPed: I see a bunche of like {{{stuff}}} for a fraction of a second, and then it's replaced with content.
HoloPed: Is that normal ?
icebox: Germanaz0: the point is... that md-input README is wrong or your are using it wrongly
icebox: Germanaz0: or both :)
Germanaz0: yes, I was thinking that on controller could work
Germanaz0: but outside the directive
icebox: HoloPed: ng-cloack
Germanaz0: that is what I do not know, if that could work inside a directive or just a controller
None
HoloPed: thanks icebox
icebox: Germanaz0: I don't see any reason not to work correctly inside a directive
icebox: Germanaz0: as I said, I should try it
ngperfex: any help with grunt, my project has it configured grunt with minify and concat and i just want a dev build config
Germanaz0: thanks icebox
ngperfex: which just serves all the files as is
icebox: Germanaz0: you are welcome
icebox: Germanaz0: giving another look at your snippet and README example, the main diff is input ref in the README is done in OnInit
Germanaz0: yes I also tryied that one
icebox: Germanaz0: ah ok... really I should play with the code
Germanaz0: and implementing onInit it gives a null value
Germanaz0: if I do this.searchInput
icebox: Germanaz0: perfect... that is a master try :)
Germanaz0: I only have to test it on a controller, but do not think that would do much difference
icebox: Germanaz0: agreed
Germanaz0: my other through is that inside a directive we could have already have access to the viewChild but I do not know how
None
Germanaz0: I was about to read that to understand better the directives
icebox: Germanaz0: me too :)
icebox: Elarcis: busy, away or whatever? :)

icebox: Germanaz0: sigh... thanks for the feedback
ZoderUck: o :)
Germanaz0: icebox and are you something from material2 ?
icebox: Germanaz0: do you mean if I have been using material2?
ZoderUck: normal you have json kind of javaobject to map on php std classes.  how do you map std php class with properties to AngularJs ?
Germanaz0: or developing it
ZoderUck: the best approach
icebox: Germanaz0: not yet
icebox: Germanaz0: I have been using material1... and contributed to it
Germanaz0: awesome
icebox: ZoderUck: that question would be better in javascript channel :)
ZoderUck: ow. hmn.
ZoderUck: icebox you knjow the StdClass of php a plain simple object with properties to hold entities
icebox: ZoderUck:  I don't use php... so no idea
ZoderUck: what do you use for backend ?
Pyrrhus666: ZoderUck: php has json_encode (and json_decode)
icebox: ZoderUck: nodejs
ZoderUck: aha ok, thanks Pyrrhus666
ZoderUck: that is what i did see indeed
ZoderUck: and that automaticlly results in properties
None
ZoderUck: aha ok. let me have a look moment :)
learnme_: If I have 4 components (angular 1.5) that depend on MyResource.query(), and I update one of 4 components with a MyResource.save(), is there a way to notify all the other components of the change in state?
learnme_: I would have figured angular would take care of this for me, but I appear to be wrong, :(
icebox: learnme_: no need for that...
learnme_: icebox: What did I do wrong then?
icebox: learnme_: I suppose your components share a service with a reference of your data
learnme_: yessir
learnme_: And the service is dependency injected (if that makes a difference)
icebox: learnme_: perfect... when the reference is updated, the changes are automagically propagated to the components...
icebox: learnme_: if you didn't broke the reference :)
learnme_: Yeah, I must have broke the reference
learnme_: because nothing changes :P
wolfe: can ng-list only be used on puts?
wolfe: on inputs*
None
learnme_: yeah, I think I bound it down with a ''
learnme_: that's the right way to do it right:?
learnme_: And then only update the parent state
icebox: learnme_: no idea... without any plunker reproducing your use case
learnme_: mk, I'll try some things and see if I can't get it to work, thanks mate!
None
icebox: learnme_: the point is... be aware when you update the reference
learnme_: mk
ghutzriop: I'm trying to install jquery for the example project on angular.io. &quot;npm run typings install dt~jquery --global --save&quot; fails with &quot;Attempted to compile &quot;jquery&quot; as an external module, but it looks like a global module. You'll need to enable the global option to continue.&quot;
umdstu: i have a directive used by/in an ng-repeat. in the directive an $http call for an image occurrs. It appears as though those image calls are all performed serially. is this normal? is there a better way to do it?
iuyiyuiyui: hello everyone
Pyrrhus666: umdstu: most browsers limit the number of concurrent connections to the same host. could that be the issue ?
umdstu: Pyrrhus666: I dont believe so. But its possible. I have something very similar written in Rails/ .erb and it works much better (though still awful for other reasons)
baako: hi guys, i dont know how to explain this but let me try. If i confuse you let me know. I have a front page(view) which doesnt have a menu. Anyways when a user clicks on  button, it takes them on a different page but this page doesnt have a menu because the menu is a template, anyways in the next page i want to include the menu this is what i have tried
None
Pyrrhus666: ghutzriop: sounds like you need the global (&acute;-g&acute;) switch (as in &acute;npm install -q&acute;)
smiche: umdstu: get all the images at once in the parent controller calling the directive, link your images with the objects you're iterating?
baako: &quot;menuContent&quot; this is a div class in the menu page
ghutzriop: Pyrrhus666, well, actuall npm run -- typings... just found it
umdstu: smiche: it&rsquo;s one image per directive, the directive is inside the ng-repeat
umdstu: smiche: still, what you say still makes some sense
umdstu: I just wanted to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t doing something anty-asyncronously
umdstu: let me write up a gist real quick
baako: i want to have a started menu template which i can use across all the pages
smiche: baako: use nested states and have ui-view:/ui-view: in the reused template
smiche: workday is over, poke me tomorrow if you think I can help you out :D
baako: smiche, thanks for the reply. I was thinking does the menu template need to be loaded at any point?
smiche: when the state changes the responding template is loaded, the parent template will nest child states in ui-view:
smiche: you can use parentstate.childstate to have the parent template wrap child state
None
None
baako: smiche, i see if i have another nested state lets say app.menu and i have another state foo.bar, will i not be able to use app.menu in foo.bar?
icebox: off... bye
baako: Pyrrhus666, hello
Elarcis: ah
Elarcis: what ever did he want D:
baako: hi Elarcis am trying to load a view in another view :D but the url on the broswer changed to the page but its still showing the home page and no console error
baako: so am thinking the view i was to load into does that view have to already been loaded at any point?
Germanaz0: is it possible to override a template from a vendor using angular2 ?
Foxandxss: I don't think you can
ZoderUck: hi, i have it difficult two make a grid responsive layout with unique input fields,  what i now do is  have 3 layouts and each layout does have  an own group of input fields.  and useq jquery to copy any typed changes to the hidden other 2 input names.    Is that a good idea in angularJs ,   for example  have 1 input field weight   and 2 hidden weight fields updated ?
ZoderUck: small, medium and large i have now
Pyrrhus666: &uml;and useq jquery to copy&uml; -- that&acute;s your problem right there. angular has no knowledge of what you&acute;re doing there.
ZoderUck: ow
ZoderUck: yes i asking advie for a better  strategy  for  maintaining  3 layouts.  now it the layout gui is maintainable.
ZoderUck: but i wonder will angular  update all the 3 input fields
Pyrrhus666: just bind all inputs to the same model ?
ZoderUck: currenlty it i s in jquery and 3 layouts.
ZoderUck: Pyrrhus666, yes i gues so, that is the way?  or should i spit out the correct html template?  when an other width size is altered
Pyrrhus666: ZoderUck: your 3 layout solution sounds weird, I&acute;m not saying anything about that ;) but you _can_ bind all three inputs, hidden or otherwise, to the same model.
None

ZoderUck: it is a beginners project
Pyrrhus666: ZoderUck: I&acute;m out of time for today, sorry. I&acute;ll be back tomorrow.
ZoderUck: i may, redesign that custom page. in AngularJs 2.0
ZoderUck: Pyr: ow ships, could you have 5 minutes ?
ZoderUck: 4 methods i need to calcluate the calories
ZoderUck: i need a component abstraction, i mean a design of interaction with the entitites
learnme_: if I have two separate components in angular 1.5 and search has a prop bound to a service like Resource.query(); How can I call Resource.save({}); to update both components? I can only seem to get on the components to update...
learnme_: each has*
ZoderUck: question, by the way i focus now on AngularJS 2.0 straight,   is AngularJS 1.3 used widely more then AngularJS 2.0 ? with typescript ?
wafflejock: ZoderUck, angular 1.x typically didn't use typescript since it wasn't really a thing yet, you could use a typescript compiler and 1.x but it's not typical
wafflejock: ZoderUck, if you like TS or want the compiler then 2.x is the way to go but there aren't as many libraries or as many experts
Elarcis: wafflejock, ZoderUck: yet stuff is way simpler when using Typescript. Controller, components, services, they're all designed to be coded with classes
None
ZoderUck: yes of course, i want stuff out of the globalscope
ZoderUck: yes, it seems logic,  but the attribute decorators needs to be imported to, strange.
ZoderUck: but, i mean do people use AngularJs 1.3  more then Angular 2.0 ?
ZoderUck: i have seen only a glimpse of 1.3 i dive directly into Angular 2.0  tuts, since the tuts is all about that.
ZoderUck: and i use yo generator
ZoderUck: do yo use yo
BaNzoune1: Hey, (noob here) I've a view that render results from $http.get(), in the same view I added a form /: and I want to update $http.get() with it. e.g. my default call is on api.example.com/users, and if in the form /: you add a name it should search on api.example.com/users?name=Value-From-input:. How would you do that?
ZoderUck: where is the stastistics of useers  Angular JS 2.0 versus Angular
ZoderUck: 1.3
wafflejock: ZoderUck, not sure there are really good statistics on that, can check google trends my feeling is 2.x is still pretty fresh and not a lot of people are using it in production yet but just the feeling I've gotten from blogs etc. so far and working with teams
ZoderUck: aha wafflejock, thank you for answering
wafflejock: ZoderUck, in one project we were using Babel for ES6 but using angular 1.5, like Elarcis said too it does work pretty well since angular is structured in a way that works well with defining classes and using those for your providers
wafflejock: ZoderUck, no prob
None
ZoderUck: time.
None
wafflejock: ZoderUck, eh ideally you want to be able to rely on just doing it through CSS changes I think or using something like the Bootstrap grid for doing responsive layouts typically shouldn't need to actually modify the HTML/DOM or anything
ZoderUck: so in the code i will remain 3 layouts so i can maintain the html layout.   a grid responsive with push and pull is difficult.  I have  duplicated input names
wolfe: any ideas on why the ng-list attr on a input would stop expressions that follow it in a ng-repeat to stop evaluating?
ZoderUck: wafflejock, yes normally  one pushes /pull a  field input  so there are not duplicated fields yes.
wafflejock: ZoderUck, yeah looks like they use bootstrap here, for each view you would have a different template
ZoderUck: wafflejock, is there a grid layout online design what you see is wha you get helper, where i define 3 layouts ? and that stuff transpiels to 1 layout ?
wafflejock: ZoderUck, have you used the angular router yet? if not that's probably the thing to start looking at, ui-router is the de-facto standard in 1.x
wafflejock: not sure what you mean by the last part
ZoderUck: mvc, in laravel and asp.net i am familiar with, that approach is also possible yes.
ZoderUck: keep 3 layouts seperate is more handy then, push and pull,  the html code is easier to read. and predict the layout right?
wafflejock: ah yeah easier to keep each view separate rather than show hide parts of the view, but the router basically handles that
ZoderUck: i mean,  assume i would like to have 1 hure html with respnsive queries,  but i want  to use a tool, what you see is what you get html grid bootstrap designer.   where i dont have to code push pull myself
ZoderUck: that is one approach use bootstrap grid
ZoderUck: but i could also choose the approach of routing, mvc   and spit one of the 3 layouts.
ZoderUck: but that means dom reloading right?
ZoderUck: or is it hidden somewhere in the dom ?
wafflejock: ZoderUck, well typically you will have each view/page in it's own template file and use angulars client side router (or ui-router) to say what views are showing at a given time and the client side router handles getting the template and pushing it into the view for you
ZoderUck: how do you design your twitter bootstrap grid layout ?
wafflejock: that I just do by coding typically you get used to it eventually... there may be tools but none I'm aware of for doing the initial layout
ZoderUck: wafflejock and you use 1 index.html file ?
ZoderUck: or router would push one of the  the 3 html views or pages even ?
wafflejock: ZoderUck, well did you decide on 1.x or 2.x I can link you relevant docs
ZoderUck: 2.0
wafflejock: yeah router will handle pushing the right views in, in the index.html you'd just have a place that says where the view goes
ZoderUck: i like the mvc routing,  3 layouts seperate in a file,  but i wonder  if the browser size is made smaller then  the page will be reloaded an initated, and the input entered data will be gone i think
None
ZoderUck: for responsive things people use twitter bootstrap  grid way. that is normal. let the media query do the stuff.
ZoderUck: ok thanks.
ZoderUck: i will read now.
wafflejock: I just followed that tutorial recently but it will get you the basic gist at first the router stuff I'll dig up
ZoderUck: wafflejock do you create your responsive  pages that way with routing ?
None
wafflejock: ZoderUck, well the responsive part is all handled with CSS most of the time and media queries in the CSS or leaning on things like bootstrap grid
wafflejock: ZoderUck, the single page application part where it doesn't reload the app/shell it just loads parts is where the routing comes in
ZoderUck: walff, yes, rich gui , loading animations bits and pieces, with custom selector whatever
ZoderUck: yes, but i wonder,  what is faster   let the media + css do hide /show of the layout   or  angularJs + javascript under the hood to alter the DOM
Elarcis: I untangled the clusterfuck that previously was the unicity checking component of the form
wafflejock: brb
Elarcis: holy molly guys, was it a brain-mixer
ZoderUck: inresponsible unreversable clusterfuck warning
ZoderUck: Elarcis: lol
ZoderUck: Elarics, you have a url of that issue you have dangled ? url with related to your context
Elarcis: ZoderUck: nope
ZoderUck: ok :)
ZoderUck: the description you gave was funny :)
Elarcis: to make it short: the guy created a directive resource-unicity-input that took the whole edited/created resource as a ngModel.
ZoderUck: uh ow.  uh
Elarcis: that directive itself had as a template a single input, with a ngValue set to a string concatenation of multiple properties of that resource, separated by '///'
ZoderUck: i am new to Angular 1.3 and Angular 2,0
wafflejock: Elarcis, pro :)
ZoderUck: dont know how a resource unicity looks like.
ZoderUck: ngModel i understand
ZoderUck: ok.
Elarcis: the input field itself implemented a resource-unicity-validator directive, which took the value of the input, splitted it by '///', and sent the splitted values to a function that COUNTS resources that have the same values for these properties (so in 100% of the cases, it returned either 0 or 1)
wafflejock: haha
wafflejock: when I'm a hot mess at least I use stringify :)
Elarcis: if the count returned more than 1, it searched for the next parent ngModel and $setValidity('resourceUnicity', thatVariableThatCOntainsEitherOneOrZero)
ZoderUck: uuh
wafflejock: totally savage
Elarcis: absolutely delightful, it took me nearly half an hour to understand what it did
ZoderUck: i have to copy that and split it into atomy, :)
wafflejock: ZoderUck, regarding using angular vs CSS for showing/hiding things for responsive design, typically better to do it with CSS/media queries because usually you have all that loaded up front and typically CSS animations do a better job of using resources
ZoderUck: i am still processing trying to understand about the splitted ///
wafflejock: ZoderUck, with angular there is an animation service and some things it helps facilitate but it mostly leans on using CSS to actually define the animations still, I've used things like VelocityJS or similar libs for doing JS animation but usually not as good
wafflejock: ZoderUck, yeah the splitting on /// doesn't make sense :) don't try to understand it will break your brain
ZoderUck: wafflejock aha thanks.
ZoderUck: and jqueryUI ther was a d.ts or an AngularJS version of it ?
Elarcis: wafflejock, ZoderUck: well it made sense in the dev's mind. he didn't use isolated scopes at all, so to him it was making sense to transmit directive parameters as string only
Elarcis: which was utterly stupid and pointlessly limited
ZoderUck: wafflejock i had once created a split_path and strip_slash_from_path , in Delphi with , i had a bad algorithm :)
Elarcis: which might explain why he didn't like directives and simply told me 'yeah I read it's bad practice to use directives anyway'
ZoderUck: in typescript you have the blockscope with the  useage of  let my_varname
wafflejock: ZoderUck, regarding jqueryui there are pieces people have wrapped up in directives to be used in angular and you can learn to do that yourself if you can't find one that does what you want, typically way to go is just google for what you want to do to the DOM and angular directive to see if one exists
ZoderUck: aha ok yes, i will. i think people use jqueryUI piieces like the calender in AngularJS somekind
None
wafflejock: right
ZoderUck: export an own class wrapper stuff i think.
ZoderUck: Elarcis, i had created once , a combobox with a html label at the right,  which had to   strip  long tekst into   &quot;bla lorum.blad....  &quot;  into small sentence with  4 dots
ZoderUck: and also that function went wrong, so funny, and the output was not predictable becaue   on diffrent windows you have an other DPI  and other fonts theme.
Elarcis: ZoderUck: pure CSS if it was in the last six years :D
ZoderUck: how do you calculate that ?  90 y, max width, all chars on that width, max and then put 4 points behind the  clipped text
ZoderUck: assume, the width is 90 px
ZoderUck: if you understand what the assignment is :)
None
ZoderUck: yes truncating. u i did not know there is a css/html snippet to do this. but i have to test the correct effect.
wafflejock: ZoderUck, eh yeah in angular unit testing is a pretty big thing so you can be sure things function as expected, with visual things like custom ui components think it's still a manual job, personally use browser stack to test on various systems
ZoderUck: aha tahnks about the tip/hint about gui testing
ZoderUck: the browser stack  = just a one of the populair browsers yes
None
ZoderUck: at this moment in asp.net and c i still dont design the unit test  procedures.   i use altough  Interfaces as much as possible, the  Unity IoC repository i use for dependency injection,   AngularJS 2.0 does have dependency injection
wafflejock: ZoderUck, personally use Ubuntu for dev work so not a lot of regular users using the same system :)
ZoderUck: i do knojw, mocking casses with expected (reference) results
wafflejock: ZoderUck, yeah DI is a big thing in Angular as well, the things you define for injecting are generally called &quot;providers&quot; or &quot;services&quot; in angular terminology
ZoderUck: in other languages too
ZoderUck: yup
learnme_: For some reason, when I update my ngResource, none of the components tied to it update. All the components are bound like this.list = Resource.query(); what did I do wrong?
None
andygmb: it seems unnecessarily long
ZoderUck: wait in angular 2.0 the directive provders services has been replaced with class
wafflejock: ZoderUck, well you just define them as classes with special annotations as far as I know but so far just dipped into 2.x have been doing 1.x for a few years though
ZoderUck: aha ok. i see.
ZoderUck: wafflejock are you here always, dont you hneed to focus on your work? i mean it is nice you give a free support service
ZoderUck: by the way, other question since you are Ubunty users,  uh the new 16.0x you use or you keep on 14.04 ?
ZoderUck: wafflejock are you in America ?
wafflejock: ZoderUck, heh yeah I need to get some things done here but I lurk here and in #ubuntu and try to help point people in the right direction here when they're getting started
wafflejock: yeah near Chicago
wafflejock: using 16.04
andygmb: wafflejock: any chance you're familiar with restangular? :D
wafflejock: andygmb, sorry never used it really, I'm aware of it but not familiar with it
learnme_: Do I have to use $onChanges in angular 1.5 using the ngResource across multiple components??
andygmb: ahh
ZoderUck: aha ok.  ok. hmn, i recently reseted my droplet at leasweb, and reinstalld with a single click, i was wondering is it better to install 16.04 since service control is new.
Elarcis: off, bye!
ZoderUck: wafflejock, could you say /tell if it vncviewer works good on ubuntu 16.04 ? with some applications some gdi libaries are not working. like visual studioe code for linux
ZoderUck: maybe you could try visual studio code for me with vnc server at your linux ubuntu 16.04 system
wafflejock: ZoderUck, yeah systemd has been fine for me so far and I like to be on the latest LTS for the 5 years of support, regarding vnc not sure really, have used some alternatives like nomachine you may want to check out usually just use virtual box for a windows instance here though
ZoderUck: systemd it is called, i did read.  is that the thing to start /stop services ?
ZoderUck: service httpd restart that kind of stuff ?
ZoderUck: i need to look that up,  i did read all linux distros go  systemd
wafflejock: yup
ZoderUck: wafflejock and now something personally, you make a living with creating apps for compannies ?  or you work for a companie ?  how is ICT in America, i am in the Netherlands and new to the html /css/jquery/javascript cloud world
ZoderUck: People in Netherlands and it think other countries companies too.  do only want  super super skilled people in jquery/html/css, a junior is not given NO assignments
wafflejock: ZoderUck, did a corporate job for a few years but for the last 3 have been just doing contract work for various businesses under my own small business
learnme_: Does anyone in here have familiarity with ngResource? I can't seem to figure something out, and could use a helping hand :P
wafflejock: ZoderUck, when I started off in the corporate job they had me doing a lot of CSS work (mostly things that wouldn't break the apps) but eventually got me writing custom UI components and then taught me the backend stuff (we used Java Spring and iBatis)
wafflejock: learnme_, from what you wrote sounds like you may be running query() many times which is making a network request for each .query() call and storing the result separately so changing one won't affect the others
wafflejock: learnme_, think you want to move the query call into a function in a provider so you can control when it gets called and store the result in the provider so you can reference it from a few places
learnme_: Ahh,
learnme_: I think I get you.
learnme_: so, I'll add a method onto my ngResource that's similar to &quot;query&quot;
learnme_: and just reference that instead
wafflejock: learnme_, well would actually have my own provider typically that uses the resource and makes the query call on the resource but in my custom provider I store the result... one sec see if I saved this recent plnkr
None
Germanaz0: Who uses atom as IDE for typescript and angular2 ?
monk12: hey all, i have some google web fonts for different languages... I was curious how I can dynamically bring them into my Angular app... at some point the controller will set a $scope.language property with lets say 'he' for hebrew... and I add a class on body tag so i can hook into .language-he {...my rules...} ...
None
monk12: anyone know a good way to do this vs doing the import at the top of the CSS which i know is legal... but then Im downloaded languages for 20 different fonts.
monk12: another ghetto way would maybe be an ng-if on a link src=&quot;fonts.googleapis.com/hebrewfont&quot; ng-if=&quot;{{language=='he'}}&quot;/: ... but then I'd have 20 link/: lines which seems inefficient.
Srgjames: with angular 2 why does it seem so complicated to build a form
zomg: monk12: you can use the typekit WebFontLoader, iirc it supports google fonts
zomg: monk12: it's on github, look for webfontloader
monk12: awesome, thanks zomg
learnme_: wafflejock: I got it working, thanks mate!
thewizzy: What are the benefits in using a one way binding on a component using '' and then using $doCheck for checking changes on a property of that object vs just making the component a two-way binding?
learnme_: thewizzy: When you have LOTS of bindings, two way becomes heavy
learnme_: So, if you have a piece of state that rarely changes, there's no need to do deep checking on it
None

keithbrown: hey I have a quick scope question
-keithbrown- I'm using ionic: I created a &quot;Notification&quot; directive that does some preprocessing to determine what type of notification ('alert', 'message' or 'important message') to display base on an object passed in an attribute. Within the template of that directive I am calling another directive called &quot;Update Notification&quot; - this is an item option that is revealed when the user slides the item to the left and (is supposed
-keithbrown-  to) calls an update modal with a form who's model is passed through an attribute &quot;notification.&quot;
-keithbrown- The problem I'm having is that the template of &quot;Update Notification&quot; is calling showUpdateNotification() but it seems to be calling the &quot;Notification&quot; directive's scope functions; even though the &quot;Update Notification&quot; directive has a defined scope.
-keithbrown- I want to define the update functionality in the &quot;Update Notification&quot; directive to be able to call it elsewhere in the app with another template, but I'm not sure how to resolve my scope issue.
Nasp: There's a special place in hell for people like you
None
keithbrown: Nasp: are you talking to me?
Nasp: Yes
keithbrown: Nasp: why so dramatic and for what?
Nasp: You just noticed the entire channel
keithbrown: Nasp: how did my asking a question affect you so negatively?
keithbrown: great then someone will be able to help
mst: keithbrown: why did you use 'notice' rather than a normal channel message?
Nasp: keithbrown:  no everyone will add you to ignore
mst: keithbrown: mass noticing like that is not how IRC etiquette works
keithbrown: i have no idea what that is
keithbrown: i copy and pasted something
mst: keithbrown: basically, you fucked up using IRC and your question has annoyed everybody without anybody being able to read it
mst: if you'd like to start again, and use the channel properly
mst: hopefully we'll be able to help
keithbrown: hows this
None
mst: ok, so now please explain the question
subone: Is there a way to use $location in the context of arbitrary URLs?
keithbrown: I created a directive that has a directive in the template nad im having scope issues
keithbrown: mst: so the template of the nested directive is calling a function but if i define the function in the parent directive it gets called but not in the scope of the child directive
mst: keithbrown: ok, not sure what you mean by 'called but not in the scope of the child directive'
keithbrown: mst: the&quot;update notice&quot; directive has a function showUpdateNotification - that is called in its template with a button. It never fires. But if i define showUpdateNotification in the &quot;Notification&quot; directive - it fires - as if its only looking at the parent directive's scope and not the scope of the &quot;update&quot; button's directive.
mst: keithbrown: this sounds to me like the bit in question is actually bound to the outer scope because of the way you've built the inner directive
ZoderUck: how can i do twoway binding with {{ }}
keithbrown: mst: can you elaborate?
ZoderUck: what type is any[] ?
ZoderUck: list of objects ?
zomg: ZoderUck: list of anything
ZoderUck: ? uh
zomg: &quot;any&quot; means anything
ZoderUck: zomg and that may be several diverent types ?
ZoderUck: different types in the same list is that possible?
zomg: afaik if it says any it basically just means &quot;don't bother trying to typecheck this value&quot;
ZoderUck: the type is proberbly stored, i will do some tests
ZoderUck: by the way if you use table and thead tbody of bootstrap will this be responsive in some default way ?
zomg: I think it just scales to width
ZoderUck: i never tried this, i did see this in a tutorial
ZoderUck: is it better to use  ul li instead of tables,  for a specific table layout ?
zomg: if it's a list use li, if it's tabular data, use a table :)
ZoderUck: and use display inline, AND a row number to see the begin of a new row
ZoderUck: it is a product row , so i gues i need to program this in a table.
zomg: if it's data you'd display as rows and columns then using a table makes sense
ZoderUck: that ngFor #products of products    product.productName is not  intellisense right ?
zomg: I'm not sure what you mean.. intellisense is just the name used for code completion in visual studio
ZoderUck: i see this in a video tutorial, so i need to test this in the real world
ZoderUck: the ide helper/intellisense that kind of sting
ZoderUck: in Delphi it is called intellisense
zomg: Oh it is? interesting, I always thought it was just a Microsoft name :)
zomg: Anyway don't really know since I just use Vim
ZoderUck: ow you know Delphi,  it is target for Windows, i gues they took it over from Visual studio long time ago
zomg: last time I used Visual Studio was VS 2005 with C# I think :P
ZoderUck: zomg, on Ubuntu ?
ZoderUck: better use nano
zomg: What possible reason would anyone have to use nano instead of vim?
ZoderUck: re removed vm, because i want to force myself to nano
ZoderUck: search and replace is better in nano
zomg: how?
ZoderUck: in my persional opinon
ZoderUck: well the menu below in nano helps e to find my way around the editor
zomg: dunno, vim does regex search and replace and intelligent case matching which seems fairly good to me :)
ZoderUck: o
ZoderUck: i am 42, and still no control of regex :| oeops.
zomg: heh
ZoderUck: bad :( i forget regex strings after a while
zomg: yeah it took me a while to really understand how it works too
ZoderUck: zomg, did you train in the bash with scripts? one needs tutorials to train
zomg: I can remember most of the commonly used regex ops but the more advanced stuff I can't remember because they're used so rarely :)
zomg: uhh
zomg: I can't remember, I think I just used them in code and at some point they just started making sense :P
ZoderUck: zomg, i think mysql does allow regex in  like %match_regex%
ZoderUck: uh i think the sql query did have the word regex in the sql select query
ZoderUck: actually regex is like driving a car, one needs to do it often
ZoderUck: if you have 3 input name fields, it is possible to  twoway bind 1 single datamodel to  all the 3 input fields ?    2 inputfields are hidden.
