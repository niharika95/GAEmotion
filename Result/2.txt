dogmatic69: Im having issues with a template parse error. &quot;Error: Template parse errors main.browser.ts:25&quot;
dogmatic69: Stack trace is all angular, but If I remove the custom selector for a component it works
var: hello
var: can anyone tell me if I need to install node and npm or can I just put in the head?
Foxandxss: put it in the head?
rand0m: haha
j0sephandres: hello
v0j: YO
None
angularjs938: Just curious when to use services instead of putting code into the controller . . .
Stag: Hi folks, is it possible to notify host element about @Input Reference change without @Output ?
raz_: hello all
raz_: how to call an web API and make that work dynamic
raz_: in html
test234: hello!
test234: I am using C# and Visual Studio
test234: How do I download this.. angular 2.. ?
test234: I see it nowhere
zomg: go on the website and read the instructions?
obv_: hi all
None
test1234: hello!
test1234: Is there a way to get angularjs working without the whole node/npm stack?
pwnd_nsfw`: test1234, no
pwnd_nsfw`: But it's probably suggested for many reasons
zomg: test1234: you need node to run modern JS tooling
zomg: test1234: think of it as a runtime for tools, that's all it is
zomg: well, that's all it needs to be. Sure you *can* use it for more if you want, but you only *need it* to run tools :)
zomg: and npm... well, if you're a C# person, you might've used NuGet... which is probably a lot easier for you to manage packages with than anything before
AxldenieD: hello :)
Foxandxss: yo
grizzm0: Yo yo yo
heartburn: hooyo-moyo.
heartburn: :o)
VincentAdultmon: Is there a nice way to use angularjs 2 without the whole node/npm etc stack?
VincentAdultmon: I just want to use it without that gunk (VS, ASP.NET MVC)
GreenJello: VincentAdultmon, probably not a nice way
VincentAdultmon: Why though?
VincentAdultmon: I don't understand why I need all of that
GreenJello: you should either embrace it or not use it at all
VincentAdultmon: But.. VS does all of that for me.. Compiles typescript etc
GreenJello: you don't want your project tied to a specific editor
GreenJello: since other people you work with may use different editors
VincentAdultmon: hmm, I mean.. VS 2015 update 3 seems to allow js task runners now
VincentAdultmon: but all the same, it feels so janky
VincentAdultmon: Surely I should be able to just include some JS files?
GreenJello: yeah, but I don't know if you'll be able to use third party stuff on npm
GreenJello: I hear typescript does bundling though, so if you have that up you might be able to use stuff from npm
VincentAdultmon: typescript doesn't do bundling
VincentAdultmon: But the ASP.NET MVC runtime has bundling + minification
GreenJello: why are you looking to replace asp.net?
VincentAdultmon: I am not
VincentAdultmon: I want to use it
VincentAdultmon: In fact.. All I want is ASP.NET MVC Web API (for a restful API) and an angular 2 front end
VincentAdultmon: No actual ASP.NET front facing at all
GreenJello: ah okay
GreenJello: then give angular 2 a try, with the normal tooling for it, and if you really hate it after a while you can look into alternatives
VincentAdultmon: yeah.. ok.. I will
VincentAdultmon: It's a little awkward considering at work we don't have that ability
zomg: VincentAdultmon: if VS compiles TS for you, it *probably* includes nodejs in its distribution somewhere :P
zomg: because the TS compiler is written to run on node
zomg: but yeah if VS has all the tooling you need for it - then sure, no need for anything else
ishion: Evening
ThusSpakeHarambe: so theres no official angular 2 channel yet with people who actually know angular 2
ThusSpakeHarambe: ?
ThusSpakeHarambe: cause i went into angular2 and so far cant speak too highly about whats been asked and/or posted in there, pretty surprised, theres almost always a freenode channel with active and informed people for major technologies
grizzm0: This would be the official angular2 channel
ThusSpakeHarambe: oh okay
ThusSpakeHarambe: someone said otherwise the other day
ThusSpakeHarambe: that being said, kind of weird to have angular 1.x and 2 in the same channel since they are completely different frameworks almost
Docmarten:  hrrrmmm....tab1 -: loads page1, page1 lists all items which link to page2.  At bottom of page2 is link for another item that loads page2 again (with new item info), always at the bttom of page2 is link to reload page2 with new item info.  However, i want the soft backbutton at the top to go directly back to page1 item list no matter how many page2 links the user follows.
Docmarten:  currently, Tab1 -: page1 -: page2(a) -: page2(b).  page2(b) backbutton goes back to page2(a), but I need it to go back to page1
gain_: hello to all
gain_: anyone uses angular with visual studio?
VincentAdultmon: 13:27  zomg: VincentAdultmon: if VS compiles TS for you, it *probably* includes nodejs in its distribution somewhere :P
VincentAdultmon: Is that some kind of joke? TS is an MS product.
mst: and? it's an MS product that uses node.js as its runtime
mst: they've even released it on npm
Docmarten: frickin love angluarJS!!!
ThusSpakeHarambe: mst: 2015 comes with the ability to compile typescript and has nodejs + npm distributed with it
ThusSpakeHarambe: before that im pretty sure you had to install additional extensions and have nodejs already running on your machine
mst: right
mst: VincentAdultmon was the one who didn't believe it
ThusSpakeHarambe: oh i c
ThusSpakeHarambe: yeah MS is trying to not break process with open source stuff and distribute through conventional means and using conventional tooling
ThusSpakeHarambe: at least recently they are
ThusSpakeHarambe: but if you have different people using different editors the distributed nodejs can be problematic
None
dogmatic69: it seems to be related the the component not being loaded properly
dogmatic69: &quot;Error: Template parse errors&quot; if you dont feel like viewing the stacktrace there...
umdstu: trying out ng2, trying to use ng2-bootstrap with javascript (not typings), not sure how to account for the lack of system.config file
zomg: VincentAdultmon: as others suggested, there's nothing wrong with ms including node to run tsc... it would seem a bit strange for them two build two separate compilers for typescript :)
dansa: Does the date filter understand a date-string such as &quot;2016-10-02 19:15:00&quot;?
raxr: is it possible to show to render the view only after a promise in the controller has been resolved?
aleamb: raxr: use route resolve
FarceLemma: Anyone know of any angular2 sidebar/hamburger menu packages/tutorials
grizzm0: FarceLemma, If you want material design you have mseemann/angular2-mdl which is an angular2 implementation of google/material-design-lite
grizzm0: angular/material2 also has a sidenav component. But the rest of the package is not really useable just yet.
beat25: Quick question: my app is basically displaying a bunch of lists, sometimes multiple lists on the same page and sometimes with the ability to search that list with a little search box on the top. No i'm using the same controller/template for all these lists, and also the same for the searchfield. is it okay for me to get the parameters for how the lists are different with the $attrs variable from the html?
beat25: or would i rather make a service that generates an array of lists from the routing and the html just display's an array of all lists based on that array?
FarceLemma: @grizzm0 i do like mseemann/angular2-mdl and angular/material2 looks sick for whenever that gets done, thanks!
None
umdstu: think i&rsquo;ll stick to angular 1x :)
