beat25: How can we use a shared component in multiple files for routing. I'm aware of using a shared.module that we then import into other modules but this doesn't work for routing?
None
kefka_1993: Hello all. Is it possible for me to render a list of components, each which has a list of components in it?
kefka_1993: I really like Angular, but I can't find docs or examples of this anywhere and I'm wondering if I'm just thinking about the problem wrong.
kefka_1993: Another strange thing: can I even render a single list of polymorphic components? I can't apply @Component to Typescript interfaces, so I'm not sure how that's supposed to work...
kefka_1993: I did read the Hero tutorial, but it covered neither polymorphism nor nested components...
beat25: kefka_1993: yeah, just loop through them with ngfor
None
kefka_1993: beat25: So to do that, I would put **all** levels of the nested structure in a single @Component?
beat25: if you don't want that then look into routing
beat25: you can have child routers
None
kefka_1993: beat25: Aren't routers for navigation? I want to display editable parts of a big complex structure. Sorry, not trying to be difficult, just trying to understand the Angular2 way.
beat25: look at that tutorial i just sent you
beat25: exactly what you're doing
beat25: list of heroes
beat25: each of them you can edit...
kefka_1993: I read the whole thing before. The Hero tutorial is a 1D array. I want a 2- or 3- or 4D array.
kefka_1993: Think of for example, a bit outline with points and subpoints, etc.
beat25: the hero object can be as complex as you want it to be
beat25: the hero has a name, an id, and can have any property you want
beat25: even another list inside of it
kefka_1993: Yes--- the nested list is what I'm interested in.
kefka_1993: Do the objects in the nested list get the @Component annotation?
kefka_1993: I'm trying to display a nested list, but they're rendering as : [object Object]
kefka_1993: Here, let me give you code.
None
beat25: {{spec_part}} displays a js object
beat25: you need to display it's parameters
beat25: say spec_part.name
beat25: or .value
beat25: or whatever parameters you give it
kefka_1993: I get that. But what if I want to display its sub components too?
kefka_1993: Should it not have its own template html?
kefka_1993: (Given, it doesn't **have** any sub components yet, just trying to get this much working has been a challenge.)
kefka_1993: I guess what I'm really asking is, in that example, how do I get the &quot;spec.html&quot; template to render for each &quot;Spec&quot;.
kefka_1993: If I can do that, I can do the rest of the whole structure.
beat25: you're having a fundamental problem that you don't seem to understand what {{}} does.
beat25: {{}} displays a string variable but your trying to display a object
beat25: if you want to display each spec part in their own template make another component for spec part and then write it as such: spec-part *ngFor=&quot;let specPart of specParts&quot;:/spec-part:
kefka_1993: beat25: That was the first thing I tried. It kind-of works, but it seems like it renders a **new** Spec for each actual spec in the list, rather than rendering the specs in the list.
beat25: ok then you go back to the hero tutorial and see how they use an attribute on the hero component
beat25: [hero]=&quot;hero&quot;
None
beat25: really
kefka_1993: beat25: That's where I'm currently at. I tried making &quot;SpecWrapper&quot; for that reason, thinking I'd have to create a display/wrapper object for each subcomponent. But I get &quot;Can't bind to 'spec' since it isn't a known property of 'df-spec'.&quot; from the console.
kefka_1993: Yet clearly there is a property called &quot;spec&quot; on SpecWrapper.
beat25: you forgot @input
kefka_1993: OH MY GOD
kefka_1993: That was it.
kefka_1993: Thank you SO SO much for your patience.
kefka_1993: I will pass the favor forward when I can.
kefka_1993: I've been struggling with this all week.
kefka_1993: Thank you.
beat25: do you have anything to do with kafka the author?
kefka_1993: I do not. This name is from an old video game.
kefka_1993: The &quot;Kefka&quot; in that game was certainly inspired by the writer Kafka though, at least in part.
beat25: kafka is the worst
kefka_1993: So was Kefka, haha. He was a villain.
AlecTaylor: hi
None
fels: hi all - i am getting this errr : You either misspelled the module name or forgot to load it. If registering a module ensure that you specify the dependencies as the second argument.

alex88: is this for angular 2 too?
None
alex88: I can't find a solution
fiddo: how can i tell which Promise library Angular 2 uses ? which one is it?
fiddo: how would i go about finding  this out ?
GreenJello: fiddo, it might use native promises
fiddo: ok. the reason for my question is that while im ok to use the Promise library Angular 2 uses on the browser, i want to use that same library in node with typescript. (theres no point in learning 2 different Promise libraries, right?).
fiddo: @GreeJello, when you say 'it might use native promises', do you mean the browser-implemented Promise library ?
GreenJello: fiddo, correct
GreenJello: promises are part of js now, and recent browsers implement them
GreenJello: you can use a polyfill for older browsers
GreenJello: here's the browser support:
None
GreenJello: fiddo, and most promise libraries are a superset of standard promises
fiddo: oh i see.
fiddo: thats good to know. ok then, what Promise library to people use when using typescript and Node?
GreenJello: fiddo, either native promises or bluebird
GreenJello: but I don't know if typescript affects that
fiddo: (i have always assumed that  javascript Promises in browsers required Polyfill as Promises arn't ES5...sorry im a bit new to web dev!)
GreenJello: yes, for IE you need a polyfill
fiddo: oh! does Node have native Promises? OK ill give that a go. i will also try Bluebird. i  guess what i'm trying to achieve is having my knowledge of using Promises to be used on both browser and the node environment without worrying about my code breaking in one-or-the-other's environment
GreenJello: yeah, you can use native promises or bluebird in both browsers and node
GreenJello: bluebird is just native promises with extra utility functions
fiddo: ok thanks GreenJello, ill check Bluebird out. hopefully I can understand how it works with typescript
fiddo: is there a Promise-compliant library useable in both th ebrowser NAd node for Typescript?
GreenJello: fiddo, you need typescript definitions for it, but I don't know which promise libs have them
None
Lonel: Hey
Lonel: Is it possible to use Angular2 as front-end and php as backend?
Lonel: or should I go for angularJS. + php
Lonel: has anyone here used angular2 with php before??
mdk: Lonel: HTTP is abstracting this out, you can use whatever you want as a backend as long as you're serving HTTP
Lonel: mdk: thanks
san37: any nepali developers here?
lucas_ai: How can I use angularFire on my nodejs server? Using the regular firebase API is unnecessarily cumbersome in comparison.
falkkk: hey guys, got some transclude issue
falkkk: i try to compile the content of an transcluded element.. i want to dynamicly change the ng-src=&quot;{{choosenPic}}&quot;
falkkk: i treid ben nadels approach on this but didnt work so far..
None
falkkk: here is a pasteBin of my directive
None
falkkk: new question
falkkk: two directives with different attributes = array(its a lightbox for photos) but when i use them the attributes get mixed up
falkkk: how can i isolate them?
falkkk: anyone there?
RSHED: JOIM
RSHED: JOIN
falkkk: is that a hint?
Asido: I am confused. I use angular2 with ngrx states. I have integrated a 3rd party widget, which is a vanilla js and is rendered inside an iframe. I have a plugin, which hooks into the library and dispatches app state changes during some events inside that iframe. the problem is that my angular components don't update the ui, even though they are directly connected to app state observables
Asido: i.e. {{ appStateProperty | async }}. I subscribe to in inside component and I get notified about changes, but the ui doesn't refresh anyways
Asido: what I have to do is issue a delayed setTimeout(() =: detectChanges()) inside subscription functor
Asido: I wonder if there is a universal way to the plugin could execute in order to tell angular check for changes in all children starting from a specific parent
Asido: injecting NgZone and running mutations from there works
mcfdez: Hello. I'm implementing ui-bootstrap modal in my app. In the open function of te&iexcl;he modal I have a resolve to pass some data to the modal. In the controller of the modal I console.log this resolve and comes well, but I see an error that says Unknow provider &quot;nameOfTheResolve&quot;
mcfdez: Any suggestion please?
mcfdez: solved
bobss: folks, does it sound like a bug that when you use ngModel to bind a multiple value select to a property you have to have pre initialized that property to be ar array?
bobss: should angular 2 create the array on the property?
bisch: Does using TypeScript with real Modules replace the need for DI?
bisch: Syntactically that is...
nosthertus: can anyone help me on how to make a $compile result to be a string so i could use it in a jquery library?

chris___: hi I'm trying to add cors setting to my angular-cli projet, in which file should I ass this ?
mark__: hi
mark__: is it possible to get any answers here about angular.js design principles ?
mark__: hi anyone here ?
beat25: mark__: just ask and hope someone sees it
mark__: can you help me beat25?
mark__: :)
beat25: stop asking meta questions
mark__: right, so here's a real one then. I'm starting to learn angular1 ( coming from .net background ) , and am confused about how to aply dry in my controlers. Things like generic error message collecting and other.. Should I create a service, or should I somehow make a base controller
mark__: i know I can create a NotifyService and have my generic response message built there ... But all those tutorials say services are for data access only
beat25: angular 2 released a few weeks ago... might also be worth looking at that
beat25: you can use services for that ye
mark__: yea I know, but I have allready built this ionic app in angular 1
mark__: so am trying to refactor now as much as I can
mark__: apply DRY and such
mark__: principles
mark__: beat25
mark__: what about things like
mark__: VM metadata
mark__: so I have my JSON from web api, but would like to extend it on client side
mark__: things like
mark__: product.hasVariants
mark__: and such
mark__: simple VM properties
mark__: what's the proper way to do that in angular1
mark__: ?
mark__: so I allready have this service that gets products from restful service, but would like to know proper way to extend those objects in angular
beat25: well if you're in angular 1 everything is super complicated
mark__: yea duh
mark__: xD
mark__: i see that
mark__: :)
beat25: so if you wanna make class out of json you can use factories
beat25: that take your json data and create a new class that extends the json data and spits out a new class
beat25: if that's what you're looking for
mark__: and my factory holds the logic to transform object ?
mark__: factory creates new object right ?
mark__: do you have any example for this ?
mark__: beat25 do you have any example I could look at ?
None
beat25: todd motto is really good
None
mark__: THIS IS KOOL BEAT25
mark__: for dummies
mark__: just what I need :)
beat25: i really recommend going to angular 2
mark__: oh i will
mark__: this is just this 1 app I have kinda working allready
beat25: i spent weeks trying to understand all of angular 1 and when i got it, angular 2 made everything super easy
mark__: what is the thing with var vm = this
mark__: is that same as $scope
mark__: ?
heartburn: mark__: var vm/ctrl/self/me = this; is the way to get a grasp on your current scope. you don't really need $scope for that, but the purpose is loosely similar.
superpws: How arrays are created in angularjs 2?
None
superpws: The HTML and CSS part is pretty much the same, but I have no idea how add/remove resources in JS 2.
superpws: Any help will be appreciated.
FarceLemma: @superpws Add: resources.push(value)
FarceLemma: Remove: resources.splice(index,1)
FarceLemma: angular2 arrays are created liiiiiike .........        resources:obj[];
FarceLemma: sry for the 15 min response lol
superpws: @FarceLemna every variable is by default an array (or act as an array)?
superpws: Because &quot;push&quot; implies that it's an array.
None
superpws: ^^ This is how arrays are created in JS1.
superpws: But this syntax doesn't work for JS2.
