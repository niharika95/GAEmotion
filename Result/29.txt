parv: is there any specific way to use track by $index with key value pair in ng-repeat?
railsguest: Apologies, this is a noob question, but I'm having trouble finding consensus.  I'd like to include ui.bootstrap in my project, and would prefer not to use a gem for managing JS dependencies because they will get out of date.  I haven't found any good tools for correctly integrating ui.bootstrap with the Rails  asset pipleline.   Does anyone have any recommendations?
railsguest: This is assuming that I installed the ui.bootstrap package from bower.

nishu-tryinghard: how can we create a object from this?
nishu-tryinghard: do we have to split and regenerate the object or is there a simple or direct way to do this?
nishu-tryinghard: i think it does require custom code to do this as n is repeated. Dont think there is any direct way to do this
zomg: nishu-tryinghard: probably a custom system yeah
nishu-tryinghard: yes i saw n is repeated so they need some custom way to parse it.

mi2oon: hi there guys.. hope you can help me out. I have two angular apps on a page and I want them to share a service and not manually trigger the loop. Is it possible with angular 1.5.8?

zomg: peter____: first thing to do would be to isolate *what* is taking so much time
zomg: your question describes all the things that are going on, but it doesn't really say which part of that is taking so much time
zomg: for example, if you're loading data, how long is that taking?
zomg: how long does it take to simply load all the 20 modules?
zomg: etc.
zomg: you can find this information from the network tab in chrome dev tools or using one of its tools
None
theCole: peter_____ how much data are you trying to load at once?
theCole: from your db
theCole: im not certain you this is an angular problem
zomg: peter_____: yes, I looked at it but the info I mentioned isn't there. You need to add that info or we will not be able to help.
peter_____: the issue is in the nested ng-repeat
theCole: peter_____ how much data are you repeating over?
theCole: can you link to some sample code ?
theCole: with a sample data set
peter_____: I added some code to the questions
zomg: peter_____: how did you determine the nested repeat is the problem?
peter_____: I am using the timeline in google chrome developers tools to estimate the time of loading and when I remove this section totally I found the performance very good
zomg: ok, makes sense
zomg: try adding a trackby into the ng-repeat, that has often produced better performance
peter_____: Okay great! to which level do you think this will enhance the performance?
wafflejock: peter_____, track by on any ng-repeat will help to some degree, see you did some one time data binding as well would do that to any elements you can in there
wafflejock: peter_____, if you are doing this with tons of items you probably want to use some sort of component that will do &quot;virtual scrolling&quot; or infinite scrolling where it only renders the elements on screen something like what ui-grid does
wafflejock: peter_____, ah see your reply in the comments, with only a few items this shouldn't be taking nearly that long, would look deeper into the timeline output where you can drill into what calls are taking time to see what's going on there

theCole: how large is that payload ?
theCole: is there somewhere you can upload that response for testing ?
theCole: maybe gist or dropbox ?
peter_____: Yes sure
peter_____: I will add the JSON to the question
theCole: ok
theCole: thanks
peter_____: I will try to make demo on codepen.io
peter_____: how can I reach you outside here?

psav: Hi all
psav: I am testing a web app, there is a modal on the page, how, using javascript, can I find and close that modal
psav: I've tried many things like
psav: angular.element($x('//error-modal')[0]).scope().close()
psav: angular.module('app.error').controller().component('errorModal').controller().close()
psav: but not knowing much about angularjs I'm a little stuck
psav: can someone tell me how I can get a hold of the modalInstance?
psav: that seems to be the object that I need
