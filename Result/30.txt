axcl: Hello
axcl: I am creating a new project with brand new angular 2 am stuck at a point where i am thinking how can i group various components in a group e.g. A user module has its Login, Register, View etc module and same as for some other module say manager then what should be good practice creating a component for each ?
axcl: anyone there?
farhad__: i have created angular project via ng new. now i want to create another. but i encounter this: You cannot use the new command inside an angular-cli project.
axcl: @farhad__ just cd .. and try the same command i think you are trying to run a project inside a ng project
farhad__: axcl: im on another directory!  and something that i cant understand when we create a new project via ng init. why it creates ~/src ?
farhad__: axcl: if i change my current user it creates another project for me!!!!
farhad__: in my opinion it should create codes just on current directory, not on my home directory!!!!!
farhad__: i cant understand :(

tobias: johnny_|_: john papa has some great ones out on pluralsight
farhad: im sorry to say this, but what does ng build do?
tobias: farhad: you should be able to find that out yourself - the ng cli tool is opensource
lomnafsk: hi
antiPoP: which is the proper way to place a class in a ng2 project?
antiPoP: is there a better wayto rewrite this? *ngIf=&quot;mainTime.seconds || mainTime.seconds === 0&quot;
GreenJello: maybe: mainTime.seconds != null
GreenJello: or typeof mainTime.seconds === 'number'
GreenJello: depends on exactly what you want to check
antiPoP: GreenJello, the issue is that mainTime.seconds can be null or 0
GreenJello: your current check allows 0 but not null
GreenJello: and typeof would do the same
GreenJello: as would != null or !== null if you don't care about undefined
antiPoP: sorry, it can be undefined too
antiPoP: I guess typeof mainTime.seconds === 'number' is fine (or my solution)

Goodman: Hi guys, can one ask question about angular 2 here?
soee: Goodman: sure
Goodman: So, i just got into Angular 2 and im developing a site with php as backend. Im facing a little problem here, im running xampp as a server. Angular it self is compiled with tsc. I have made the backend with the necessarily routes, but when i return the index.html(angular 2 built) it shows empty. When i check the tsc it doesnt compile it.
Goodman: But when i check the browser console, it gives me all the console logs from the .ts files, like i have few http request with observables and they are working fine. But page it self is blank
merpnderp: I have a weird VS question. I'm using vs2015 with angular 1.2.x and created a new project where I want to load angular modules with angular.bootstrap. But the VS project fails to build, because my init file isn't a module.
Goodman: Got any idea why the dom it self doesnt get rendered?
merpnderp: I really hate having VS constrol so much of the tsc build process as I have idea how to make VS start the build with my init file as the target.
merpnderp: If it helps here is my init file that VS wont' build.
None
merpnderp: I get tsc.exe exited with code 1
Goodman: Anyone?
LIERO: with Angular UI Router, I can&acute;t have index.html as my home page?

None
axsuul: Angular vs. React vs. Ember for large apps--why did you end up choosing Angular?
GreenJello: axsuul, anguler 2 and react are good options, I don't know about ember, and I had issues with angular 1
axsuul: GreenJello: using angular 2 now?
GreenJello: using react at work, looking to try angular 2 on my next side project
GreenJello: from what I can tell, angular 2 and react are pretty similar
GreenJello: like you can point out a million differences, but at the core you structure things in a similar way

angularjs385: Hi all, I struggle to find examples to initialize a reactive form with data loaded by a HTTP request. The form is created before the HTTP request, it only includes some fields of the model. How do I get the form data back into the complete model?
