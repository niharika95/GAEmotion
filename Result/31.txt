bean: I'm seeing strange behavior in ng2 where my array of Objects is populated by an http response but immediately after a console.log() claims it is undefined.  in the template the array prints without issue so it can't really be undefined ...
j4f-shredder: I have 3 files in the controllers folder, and one file to combine these 3 into one file to include in the index file, how do I do to unify it? I use require('./campaignController'); require('./sponsorsController'); require('./dashboardController');  but it doesn'twork
j4f-shredder: app.controller('dashboardCtrl', function($scope,$http){      $scope.dashboard=&quot;Dashboard Placeholder&quot;;  });
j4f-shredder: the 3 controllers has the same code
vicatcu: hey all, using angular2, i set up a 2-way data binding on a select menu, and bound a handle rto the (change) event on that select menu
vicatcu: but when my handler gets called, it's like i get the value before the change reported in my handler
vicatcu: what's the deal? how do i get the value the menu was changed-to delivered to my handler
vicatcu: ?
vicatcu: my select template looks like this: select (change)=&quot;updateValue($event)&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;selectedValue&quot;:
vicatcu: and i need the change handler because when the selection changes, i need to update other aspects of my component
vicatcu: google is getting me nowhere with this
nisseni: I've got a case where the client want's a web app to control Customers, and their Employees that have gone through a certain Education and gotten a Certificate. I'm thinking that it might be a good opportunity to learn something like Angular. Is it recommended to build a &quot;base&quot; with Laravel and then make some components using Angular. What's the best approach?
zomg: nisseni: the &quot;ideal&quot; architecture would probably be to have an API which produces JSON, which you can then consume from Angular
zomg: If you like Laravel, you can certainly use it for this purpose
nisseni: zomg: sounds cool. So laravel in the background for saving. Maybe instead of using Laravel, should I use something like Firebase? For storage.
zomg: That's entirely up to you
nisseni: zomg: But that's an option?
zomg: Sure, anything that you can access via HTTP works
nisseni: zomg: And speed wise, is it ok to use some kind of API or is it preferable to use something else like a nosql-solution?
zomg: In general even if you use a nosql DB, you would still want to wrap it with an API to ensure correct access privileges and ensure the data that goes in is valid etc.
nisseni: zomg: ok, thanks
anli_: Can multiple elements use the same controller?
anli_: Oh, they get different scopes
daedeloth: any tips on how to get an app to work on IE9?
daedeloth: I'
daedeloth: I'm getting this now: Unable to get value of the property 'remove': object is null or undefined
daedeloth: I think it's related to classnames

laurensvanpoucke: What's the best way to evaluate a nested object expression? Like {{ account.plan.type }} . If account is an async object?
Satenik: Hi
Satenik: i want to use angular material grid system. But there isn't working it.
None
daedeloth: alright almost there *yay*
daedeloth: now just need to fix my routing
None
daedeloth: the webapp part is wrong there :) any tips?
icebox: daedeloth: do we need to guess what is wrong?
icebox: daedeloth: if it is the hashtag, use html5 mode
None
None
ngbot: angular.js/master e77f717 Martin Staffa: docs(guide/Conceptual Overview): fix external api example...
daedeloth: icebox, I think this is the fallback for ie9
daedeloth: but it doesn't seem to work as expected
None
ngbot: angular.js/master 79d2b9a Jason Bedard: refactor($parse): remove unused expression arguments...
icebox: daedeloth: ok, I see... and how shall we help you? :)
icebox: daedeloth: IE9 :)
icebox: daedeloth: what is that?
daedeloth: well perhaps somebody has experience with that?
icebox: daedeloth: about what?
daedeloth: history.js I guess?
daedeloth: I am not really following your logic
testx: how are you supposed to change the view from inside a directive?
icebox: daedeloth: me too... really
daedeloth: well I'm guessing the angular2 router and history.js don't play very well together and maybe someone has got it working
icebox: daedeloth: what is the description of the concern? any code detail?
icebox: daedeloth: only now you are saying it is angular 2... sigh... thinking it was angular 1
icebox: daedeloth: and what is history.js?
icebox: daedeloth: we don't know your setup... it seems you give it for granted
daedeloth: sorry history.js was wrong
daedeloth: this is just the &quot;getting started&quot; app bootstrapping our application
testx: trying to use routing, i have a ng-view, it loads a template that uses a custom directive, the custom directive then loads a template that contains the content, the content consists of a div made to look like a button with ng-click=&quot;$location.path=&quot;#!newurl&quot;
daedeloth: so I figured, since everything is configured as it is in the online manual, I could skip those parts
testx: is that how you are supposed to use ng-views and do routing?
icebox: testx: generally speaking, if you need multiple and nested views, you need to use ui router, because ng-ruote doesn't support those features
None
testx: icebox: well not nested views
testx: what do you mean it doesn't support multiple views? displayed at the same time?
testx: i just have a single div data-ng-view:/div:
testx: need to switch out the main page with other pages when the user clicks a link
testx: or clicks a div made to look like a button
testx: how do i do this? div data-ng-click = &quot;$location.path='#!newurl'&quot;:/div:?
testx: and inject $location into the directive?
testx: do i need to specify $location as a dependency of the module containing this directive?
testx: anyone?
Pyrrhus666: testx: for links, just use regular hrefs. for clickable things, I use $location.path(newUrl);
Pyrrhus666: path is a method (getter/setter), not a property
testx: Pyrrhus666: do i need to specify location as a dependency of the module?
Pyrrhus666: beware: if you don't use html5mode, you probably need $location.hash();
Pyrrhus666: testx: yes. and it needs to be injected into the controller..
testx: like this? var subModule = angular.module(&quot;subModule&quot;, [$location]); subModule.directive(&quot;custDirective&quot;, [&quot;$location&quot;, function($location){}]);   ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: ^
Pyrrhus666: the first injection isn't needed, I think. the second one looks good.
testx: so i don't need to inject into the subModule?
Pyrrhus666: no.
testx: so what do i do with the $location inside the directive?
Pyrrhus666: call $loction.path(somewherelse); when a user clicks something. that was the point, wasn't it ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: can i do that from ng-click?
testx: div data-ng-click=&quot;$location.path('#!newurl');&quot;:/div:
Pyrrhus666: testx: probably, if $location is in scope. but I'd go with a handler that does that.
None
testx: Pyrrhus666: how do i create a handler for the directive?
testx: subModule.directive(&quot;custDirective&quot;, [&quot;$location&quot;, function($location){ return {templateUrl:&quot;url&quot;, handler:function(path){$location.path(path);}}]);   ?
testx: or do i need to inject $scope into the directive as well and do $scope.handler = function(path){$location.path(path);};    ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: ^
testx: anyone?
Pyrrhus666: testx: you need to defined a handler in the directive's 'link' function, which you can use in a ng-click attribute.
testx: this is getting very complicated, i feel like i am almost certainly doing something wrong
Pyrrhus666: testx: have you read the dev-guide on directives ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: yes but...
testx: i just need to implement basic routing, change the view when a button is clicked
testx: i feel like the way i am doing it maybe over the top
testx: do i even need directives?
None
testx: i am getting a syntax error on   line5   :
None
testx: whats the syntax error on line 5 ?   it says the error is on the  :
Pyrrhus666: I was just about to ask why you were focussed on a directive. can't you just start with an a href: and take it from there ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: no i can't use a:/a: need to use the div
testx: but that not what the directive is
Preuk: onclick -: setLocation ?
Pyrrhus666: testx: so what _is_ the directive ?
testx:       when(&quot;/Forum&quot;, {template: &quot;div data-forum-list:/div:&quot;}).
testx: forumList is the directive
testx: angular.module(&quot;forum&quot;).directive(&quot;forumList&quot;, [&quot;$location&quot;, function($location){
None
testx: it loads a template that displays the forum list
testx: inside it theres a button( a div made to look like a button )
testx: and when you click the div i need to go to another page
testx: basically another view
testx: i am using directive here as custom web components
Pyrrhus666: sounds okay. and your code looks okay. so, you get an error or something ?
testx: well its not working
testx: it doesn't do anything
Pyrrhus666: no errors on console ?
testx: i put a console.log in go(){console.log(&quot;Test&quot;;} and its not printing anything
testx: and no errors
testx: the go function isn't getting called
testx: changed this.go to scope.go and still no lucj
testx: luck*
testx: is this the proper way to make local functions in a directive?
Pyrrhus666: dunno if it's the proper way, it's the way I did it :)
testx: gtg
testx: do i need to inject $scope into the directive as well?
Pyrrhus666: ah, yes. you should, totally missed that one :)
testx: got dced
None
testx: Pyrrhus666: still not working
testx: doesn't print test
Pyrrhus666: don't inject it in the module, do it in the link function
veeru: i want to add custom field(&quot;subDomain&quot;) in every http request. and i am using interceptors to pass the value.but i am unable to see the field i added.
testx: Pyrrhus666: ?
veeru: how to add custom field in headers
testx: link: [&quot;$scope&quot;, function(scope){}] ?
Pyrrhus666: testx: oops, my bad. but you should have scope  _and_ $location injected.
Pyrrhus666: veeru: look at $http interceptors. it's in the docs
veeru: ok
testx: i hate this, all i need to do is change the url when a click occurs
testx: this is a nightmare
Pyrrhus666: testx: then use a href looking like a button instead of a div ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: i would if i could
Pyrrhus666: testx: why can't you ?
testx: because i can't change that part of the code
Pyrrhus666: testx: ah, that sucks. you could of course ditch the directive and use an ng-repeat to build the list.
testx: is there some way to make this work?
testx: div data-ng-click=&quot;go('#!Forum');&quot; class=&quot;panel-body&quot;:
testx: this div is inside the templateUrl for the forumList directive
Pyrrhus666: sure. you're almost there. the 'go' function should have both $scope and $location injected, and take a path as an argument.
testx: Pyrrhus666: why does it need scope?
Pyrrhus666: soory, my bad, it doesn't. the directive does :)
Pyrrhus666: btw : your link function should have $scope injected, not scope, that's not a thing.
testx: still not working with $scope
Pyrrhus666: can you build a functioning (as far as possible) plunk of your code ?
None
Pyrrhus666: testx: I can't debug that...
veeru: but it is showing $http.defaults.headers.common is undefined
testx: Pyrrhus666: do you see anything wrong though?
Pyrrhus666: testx: no.
testx: Pyrrhus666: looking at it in batarang i get an event
testx: go is undefined
testx: someone please help, this is eating up hours
Pyrrhus666: wait a minute... why is your directive restricted to attributes ? shouldn't it be 'E' fore element ?
testx: Pyrrhus666: why does that matter?
testx: its restricted to attributes because of IE compatibility
testx: i need to define the handler function go inside the isolate scope of the forumList directive
testx: oh no
testx: i just realized my derp
testx: i need to define the go function in the mainView directive
testx: was looking at the wrong file all along
None
testx: i a getting unknown provider error
Pyrrhus666: you haven't injected $location
testx: Pyrrhus666: what yes i have
testx: you mean into link?
Pyrrhus666: not in your link function
None
testx: i think its because it can't inject scope for some reason
testx: it says it can't find a scopeProvider
None
Pyrrhus666: sory, you were right, it's been a while since I did this stuff.
Pyrrhus666: I'm trying to build a tiny plunk, hold on.
testx: Pyrrhus666: well getting rid of scope worked
None
testx: when i set location.path it keeps going to the default route
testx: 								div data-ng-click=&quot;go('#!Forum');&quot; class=&quot;panel-body&quot;:
testx:       when(&quot;/Forum&quot;, {template: &quot;div data-forum-list:/div:&quot;}).
testx: why is it going to the default route?
testx:     $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
Pyrrhus666: I have no experience with hashed urls, I guess it thinks that '/Forum' !== '#!Forum'.
Pyrrhus666: shouldn't you just use '/Forum' in your path ?
testx: well this works
testx: 							li:a class=&quot;navBarBtn&quot; href=&quot;#!Forum&quot;:Forum/a:/li:
testx: so i thought go('#!Forum'); would work as well
Pyrrhus666: testx: I don't know if $location expects that.
testx: yeah you are right /Forum works
testx: thanks for all the help
testx: it only took several hours
testx: XD
Pyrrhus666: testx: that's somehwat logical : the weird hashed-url stuff should be visible only in the browser, not in angular (apart from the config)
None
Pyrrhus666: it is very hard for others to help you debug from random bits of code...

Jeroen2: Can someone explain me how to get all controllers in sperated files?
Jeroen2: I only get them in one file but want them in an individual file.
Jeroen2: Or is it only possible when including them all in the index file? :/
ZoderUck: hi
ZoderUck: can i ask something here?
uru: ZoderUck: You just did.
ZoderUck: ow shoot
uru: :p
uru: If its angular related then just ask it. No need to ask to ask.
ZoderUck: uru, ships not angular related but hash password encryption related
uru: Then here is most likely not the best place to ask :)
ngWalrus: ngResource makes me sad sometimes :(
ngWalrus: works great like 95% of the time and then you forget that you can't send a request body with delete and you wonder why your code doesn't work
Pyrrhus666: funny, I didn't even know the specs allowed a body with a DELETE
zomg: it doesn't seem to follow typical REST patterns anyway if you send a body with DELETE
None
ngWalrus: the root of the problem is that the api needs it
leonard_: can I make every row in the table clickable and trigger the ng-click function where &quot;x&quot; is the selected row data.id
zomg: Jeroen2: you can do angular.module('yourmodule').controller('Foo'....) in another file if you want
zomg: Jeroen2: the other way of doing it would be to use commonjs or es6 modules
ngWalrus: and the spec of delete is pretty vague
zomg: leonard_: if you replace x with row.id I think that should work
Pyrrhus666: ngWalrus: it says it has no semantics and warns it might be ignored, is all it says. that's not much to go on, agreed :)
leonard_: zomg: thanks
ngWalrus: I'm actually not sure if even our backend is working
ngWalrus: for some reason our backend coder doesn't test any of his code
Pyrrhus666: ah yes, the old 'our users are our testers' idea :)
Preuk: ngWalrus: testing leads to doubting
ngWalrus: more like &quot;our frontend guy is the tester and I'll whine and moan whenever there's a bug or feature request&quot;
Pyrrhus666: Preuk: .. doubting leads to the dark side ?
Preuk: doubting leads to design by contract
Preuk: which one is worst ? ;)
Pyrrhus666: aren't they equivalent in a lot of cases ? ;)
Preuk: depends on how much spare devs you have
zomg: automated testing : u
ngWalrus: I wish our client appreciated automated testing
ngWalrus: but obviously features are much more marketable than a solid codebase
zomg: they appreciate your software works and you deliver features quick though
Jeroen2: I have a ng-route with: .when(&quot;/&quot;, {} but I want to add also &quot;/home&quot; to that, is that possible in the same line?
zomg: which automated tests contribute towards :P
Preuk: the problem is business expecting perfect software without investing in the &quot;perfect&quot; part
ngWalrus: &quot;Specified database entry(entries) no found.&quot;
ngWalrus: when I search the database for that entry it is found
Preuk: ngWalrus: wrong datasource?
ngWalrus: it's a backend bug
zomg: tbh it just seems plain wrong to have separate people work on backend / frontend
zomg: if you have a backend issue that's blocking your frontend work, you should be able to go and fix it
Preuk: amen that
Pyrrhus666: extrapolating from that a dev should do _everything_ to avoid blocking ;)
Preuk: at least get fullstack teams/scrums/office/whatever
ngWalrus: zomg  I agree
Preuk: btw, any freelance interested in a ng2 project init/jr dev coaching remote job?
Preuk: if so, when &amp; how much?
ngWalrus: thing is though that the backend code is interesting to say the least so I don't really want to touch it
Preuk: ngWalrus: can't touch this? :)
ngWalrus: don't want to touch this :^)
zomg: ngWalrus: literally every time you say something about it makes your job sound worse and worse
zomg: lol
ngWalrus: the situation is complicated
ngWalrus: new projects have automated testing and coding standards and stuff
dman777_alter: in my template I have  {{showCode ? choice.code : choice.description}}.... it results to true and uses choice.code even if showCode is &quot;false&quot;. Why is this?
Pyrrhus666: because showCode contains the string &quot;false&quot; which is in fact true ?
Preuk: showCode === true maybe?
dman777_alter:  ah... I was thinking that
dman777_alter: showCode is a attribute from the directive... any way to convert it from a boolean to string in the directive?
Pyrrhus666: showCode!=&quot;false&quot; ?
Pyrrhus666: so like {{ (showCode!=&quot;false&quot;)?...:...}}
senayar: .toString()
senayar: dman777_alter:
senayar: but you can cheat and pass your boolean as string directly to your attribute directive
senayar: scope : { boolean : '@' } and your are done
None
Jeroen2: I mean how can I access the variable &quot;page&quot; in $routerProvider? I now tried to get it in my $scope, but that doesn't work for some reason.
Pyrrhus666: Jeroen2: look at the resolve feature to pass stuff from route definition to you controller
senayar: page does not exist
None
Pyrrhus666: search for resolve
None
dman777_alter: thanks
None
gabykant: Hi
gabykant: please I am looking for best practices. How to render different CSS in the head tag in the same file

gabykant: Someone can give a help? Please
gabykant: Or just direct me a good channel
coder_2014: how can I bind a variable with an a href=&quot;{{myvariable}}&quot;/: ?
coder_2014: I don't get it to work
coder_2014: ??
zomg: coder_2014: use ng-href=&quot;myVariable&quot;
senayar: $scope.myvariable = &quot;myvariable&quot;;
zomg: gabykant: just include them in the head, there is very little benefit of conditionally loading specific CSS files
coder_2014: zomg: Can't bind to 'ng-href' since it isn't a known property of 'a'
zomg: oh I wonder what &quot;useful&quot; tool gave that pointless error on ng-href...

codenbrew: jumping into angular2 for this project. first time for our team. what are some DOs and DON'Ts of Angular 2? GO!
uru: do read the tutorials, don't as stupid questions ;)
codenbrew: docs and guide are wonderful, uru
uru: There's not really that much to it other than general good coding practices. You'll want to use ngModules to break up your codebase and use the offline compiler for deploying code
uru: I can recomend typescript for it but that's down to your team's skills and needs and stuff
codenbrew: thanks uru. That's kind of how I feel about it. Actually seems quite easier to jump into than Angular 1.X.
uru: Not having any ng1 experance I can't say. But I jumped right in to ng2 with minimal issues (YMMV of course)
codenbrew: cool. being used to typed languages should make typescript pretty easy, too
uru: Well it's not a proper typed language, it has some quirks still as it still runs on a non-typesafe language
uru: anyway, home time for me, good luck with your project, codenbrew
codenbrew: thanks uru. adios

merpnderp: Is this no longer valid angular for an ng-diabled directive? ng-disabled=&quot;!applicationNameIsValid()&quot;
merpnderp: Can it not be set to a scope function that checks a scope value?
merpnderp: Here's the validator:           this.scope.applicationNameIsValid = (): boolean =: { return (this.scope.applicationName !== &quot;&quot;) ? true : false; }
zomg: merpnderp: that should work just fine
merpnderp: zomg: It was an issue with my template :)
