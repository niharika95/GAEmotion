Foreshadowing: Found the bug and fixed it, thanks for the help.
Ghost_Chilli: Hey guys, I'm just starting out with angular and having a lot of problems with paginating results. I've tried a few examples I found on the net, but they don't seem to work
Carbon_Monoxide: Hi! I'm facing a noob problem. With angular routing, i.e. it routes to a page &quot;mystie.com/firstpage&quot;. However, at my web framework, there is not such a routed page call &quot;/firstpage&quot;. When user reload, the browser tries to load &quot;mystie.com/firstpage&quot;. Then it got 404.
Carbon_Monoxide: How do I fix this with the backend or frontend controller?
here4thegear: I have a weird one. I have an array of arrays of objects. I'm pulling data from an API and as I'm building a new array of objects, I need to see if that array of objects already exists in the main array.
here4thegear: Is there a trick to this other than iterating through the main array to compair?
here4thegear: Either that or, I could go about it a different way but still advice. At the end of the day (more simply) I have an array of arrays and I need to put a count on each non-unique array.
here4thegear: [[{'key': 'val1'}, {'key': 'val2'}], [{'key': 'val1'}, {'key': 'val2'}]] from here I want to be able to know that [{'key': 'val1'}, {'key': 'val2'}] appears 2 times. and other repeating items appear x times... etc.
ezio: i just went through the quickstart
ezio: i'm an angular 1.0 vet
ezio: i'm just wondering ... are all these requests going to be made for js files in production?
ezio: 32 requests
antiPoP: which router should I use in v2? angular/router or ui-router?
mrbirkov: helllo
mrbirkov: iam confused with js frameworks. nodejs, angularks, react, meteor.. and hundreds more. Any good comparison tutorial?
None
mrbirkov: thanks heartburn
heartburn: mrbirkov: if you're aiming for web/frontend stuff, just toss a coin and pick either ng1 or react.
mrbirkov: noted
mrbirkov: I am trying to build an simple ecommerce, and recently impressed with http//shop.shop.polymer-project.org
mrbirkov: you think its possible to just use ng1/react to develop this ecommerce like app?
mrbirkov: progressive web app based on js
heartburn: assuming you already have the backend, yes.
mrbirkov: no backend. but there are some options like reactioncommerce
mrbirkov: for the ecommerce backend
mrbirkov: any other js based ecommerce backend / API?
mrbirkov: I know there is schema, moltin
mrbirkov: sorry not js based
None
Scubadude: has anyone tried to do the angularjs tutorial with vagrant on windows?
rand0m: wtf is happening
rand0m: google just issued me a challenge??? wtf?
nishu-tryinghard: rand0m, like what?
rand0m: some java program
nishu-tryinghard: yes, did you signup for any challenge?
rand0m: not sure
nishu-tryinghard: good luck solving it. Must be related to algorithm and data structure?
rand0m: ye
nishu-tryinghard: rand0m, dm me the question if you can
AxldenieD: hello :)

DelphiWorld: hello
DelphiWorld: any tutorial on building a rss reader using angular2?
zomg: that's such a specific thing that if googling that doesn't get any results, I'm 99% sure one doesn't exist =)
anubGok: @DelphiWorld interesting i just built a super simple one for reading the SEC's rss
DelphiWorld: anubGok: mind sharing if it's not private?
anubGok: one sec
DelphiWorld: anubGok: the one i'm using isn't native, i'm following a angular2 tutorial
anubGok: isn't native?
DelphiWorld: angular2 is not native, is hibrid
anubGok: native to what?
DelphiWorld: java code is native
DelphiWorld: but javascript is hibrid
DelphiWorld: it mean can be mobile and web
anubGok: ah i have never heard it defined that way but i kinda understand what you mean
DelphiWorld: ;)
anubGok: i mean js can be run in any webview and java requires an actual jvm
anubGok: anyway
anubGok: the site is here
None
None
jr3: $scope.vm.verificationDuration = verificationDuration is in my controller and is DEFINED. However in a directive isolate scope where I pass vm.verificationDuration it's coming in as undefined
jr3: any ideas?
DelphiWorld: cloning
anubGok: @jr3 would have to see code
None
anubGok: that's running behind an nginx instance
anubGok: oh wait it's private one sec
anubGok: ok it's public now
DelphiWorld: hey anubGok your repo isn't open
DelphiWorld: it require auth
ishion: as a newbie , angular 1 or 2 ?
anubGok: i just opened it
anubGok: the gogetit one
anubGok: which one delpiworld
None
ishion: as a newbie , angular 1 or 2 ?
anubGok: ok that's open now DelphiWorld
DelphiWorld: ishion: no 1 and not 2. go to ionic
DelphiWorld: ;)
ishion: ionic?
DelphiWorld: yes IONIC
DelphiWorld: a framework that itself use angular
None
DelphiWorld: anubGok: ah, that's a angular project. awesome
jr3: note that if I do {{vm.verificationDuration}} any where else in the view, its read successfully
jr3: its something to do with the isolate scope either looking too soon at vm.verificationDuration?
ishion: learn ionic ,study angular ?
jr3: Im logging it in the directive it prints undefined
ishion: ionic 1.3 or v2?
DelphiWorld: ishion: start with ionic1
ishion: tks
DelphiWorld: ishion: welcome
DelphiWorld: anubGok: where's the rss feed defined?
anubGok: jr3 how is timer defining its isolate scope
jr3: one sec
anubGok: are you sure countdown is a '='
jr3: yes
jr3: actually its  a little weird, its a oss library
None
anubGok: DelphiWorld i consume the rss using the secrsservice
DelphiWorld: anubGok: yes but where to find the feed url
anubGok: an important part though is that on the server i use the feedme package to convert rss XML to a JSON format
anubGok: ah so
DelphiWorld: so it require a server side
anubGok: yea
None
None
anubGok: this one requires it but you may be able to use something else to consume the xml directly
DelphiWorld: anubGok: so where's the server side code?
None
DelphiWorld: anubGok: node right
anubGok: ya
anubGok: jr3 i don't see countdown
anubGok: just countdownattr
anubGok: ah wait
anubGok: i see
jr3: anubGok, if I hardcode a number it works fine
DelphiWorld: i'm installing it
jr3: IM missing something, this is a modal controller that's injecting $scope
anubGok: it's weird that other values work though
anubGok: you can pass in the cancel function fine?
jr3: yea, Im very confused
jr3: yep it works
DelphiWorld: anubGok: ok, so your two rss feeds are defined in config/url.js
anubGok: ya
anubGok: and i just realized crap my service stopped working
anubGok: looks like the cert is failing whhyy
DelphiWorld: my cert is up to date :P
jay_: hey
DelphiWorld: hey jay_
jay_: i want to know about factory
anubGok: jr3 i feel like there must be just a spelling error or something lol
anubGok: jr3 do you use ng-inspect?
jr3: nope, not sure what  that is.
jay_: no never. what is that?
jr3: :O
anubGok: just an extension for debugging
anubGok: it shows the scope vars on a side panel
anubGok: it's for chrome, pretty good
jay_: what is services.
DelphiWorld: ng g interface model/feed-info
DelphiWorld: Invalid path: &quot;E:\projects\tmdev\rss\src\app\model&quot;&quot; is not a valid path.
DelphiWorld: why?
anubGok: hm not sure if you can pass a path into the name
DelphiWorld: i created the folder
anubGok: i would go into it and just use feed-info
None
DelphiWorld: the code is here:
anubGok: i think windows handles the path differently
None
anubGok: try other slash
DelphiWorld: yes i will
LIERO: apparently I can&acute;t use html5 autofocus in Angular
None
LIERO: but it breaks my ng-animation between loading states
LIERO: anyone had similar problems?
DelphiWorld: ng serve failing
DelphiWorld: how do i capture the entire error log
DelphiWorld: can't find module process-nextick-args
LIERO: hm
LIERO: it works when I add a delay
anubGok_: ng serve failing hm
anubGok_: npm install worked without a hitch?
DelphiWorld: anubGok_: yes...
DelphiWorld: anubGok_: process-nextick-args
DelphiWorld: this module is not found
DelphiWorld: so source look crapy
anubGok_: ah what version of node you on?
anubGok_: node -v
DelphiWorld: v5.12
anubGok_: might hve to get up to 6
DelphiWorld: you think this is a node issue?
anubGok_: yea npm actually
anubGok_: npm -v?
anubGok_: try npm install -g npm
anubGok_: then another npm install
DelphiWorld: 3.8.6
anubGok_: hm
DelphiWorld: strangest
anubGok_: actually maybe not then
anubGok_: this other guy installed it globally
anubGok_: but the weird thing is that process worked immediately on my 6.6 node server
DelphiWorld: what code you tryed?
anubGok_: but another did npm install -g --save process-netick-args
anubGok_: oh ng serve i forgot i never tried that on another machine
anubGok_: actually yes i did at work
DelphiWorld: let me try -g --save process-netick-args
DelphiWorld: npm install -g --save process-netick-args give 404
anubGok_: but another did npm install -g --save process-nextick-args
anubGok_: i mispelled it the first time
DelphiWorld: LOL
DelphiWorld: worked
DelphiWorld: anubGok_: lol, the reader is not returning any feed ;)
DelphiWorld: not your actualy but the tutorial one
tona: hello everyone
None
tona: how can check where is the code or who is handling this part, i havent created this page , i am trying to debug button style=&quot;margin-left:50px;&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot; ng-model=&quot;DisplayPillar&quot; ng-click=&quot;DisplayPillar = !DisplayPillar&quot; ng-hide=&quot;DisplayPillar&quot;:           div:Show Cartera/div:/button:
tona: i dont know what this mean ng-click=&quot;DisplayPillar = !DisplayPillar&quot;
tona: ng-click=&quot;DisplayPillar = !DisplayPillar&quot; i can not find it in into the controller or someplace but it working , i am trying to debug it
heartburn: tona: it's a boolean flip.
heartburn: true = !false
heartburn: false = !true
heartburn: every click DisplayPillar switches between true and false
tona: ok thanks
heartburn: you can access it from the controller via this.DisplayPillare
heartburn: or $scope.DisplayPillar
heartburn: probably the letter
heartburn: atter*
tona: but for any reason it is reaching one window , how could i know what window is or who is calling the code, i am trying to debug using firefox
tona: heartburn
heartburn: i don't know what window you're talking about m8
tona: ok i will try to explain , when i click on ng-click i mean into the button it display one window, if this is a boolean value , how could i know or watch what code is executing this window, when the user click on button
heartburn: ng-click='toggleWindow()'
heartburn: $scope.toggleWindow = function () { $scope.DisplayPillar = !$scope.DisplayPillar; }
heartburn: put a breakpoint somewhere in there --^
tona: ok thanks again
Vasa: hello, lets say I want to load data from my server using $http.get (...).then(...)  , all goes well and i get a response, but what if while waiting, the server partially responds to tell me the current % of the loading, how would I do that? thank you
Kanthu: How can I send the data to another page?
Kanthu: I have a page with submit button and a table.  I want to send the table data to another page when I click on the submit button.
anubGok: DelphiWorld thanks
Salman: Hi
Salman: Someone is there
Salman: Hi
Salman: Hi
drej: nope
drej: nobody here
Salman: Well
Salman: Do you know abt angular
Salman: Can I use java as backend with angular js
heartburn: naah.
Salman: Why
Salman: Answer please
Salman: Tell me
heartburn: if you have to ask such a question, you should read up on the matter m8.
heartburn: angular has nothing to do with backend.
heartburn: use whatever you want.
ezio: is the intent of angular2 to only use nodejs ... or is there some way to use php?
GreenJello: ezio, you can use any backend you like, but you use node for developer tooling
ezio: developer tooling?
ezio: converting ts to js?
